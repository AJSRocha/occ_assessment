Correcting for effective area fished in fishery-dependent depletion estimates of abundance and capture efficiency. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science 64: 000--000.Depletion methods are widely used to estimate capture efficiency and abundance. However, they are highly dependent on the depletion area assumed. In open-ocean depletion studies, it is difficult to determine the true area of depletion. Satellite vessel monitoring systems (VMS) offer the potential to determine the area effectively fished. Observer-collected catch-and-effort data from the 1999 Atlantic sea scallop fishery in Georges Bank Closed Area II were used to obtain spatially-explicit DeLury depletion estimates of dredge efficiency and abundance, with corrections for fished area made using VMS data. Non-area-corrected efficiency estimates often had theoretically impossible values, indicating that the na{\"i}vely assumed fished area was likely too big. Fine-scale spatial analyses on individual depletion cells confirmed this result. Corrected-area efficiency estimates exhibited reduced variability and more plausible efficiencies, with 70 \% of 289 individual depletion estimates falling between 20 \% and 55 \%, with a mean of 46 \%. Abundance estimates from individual depletion studies matched maps of abundance from a preseason survey. Results indicated a total abundance of {$\sim$}17 million pounds of scallop meat weight in the fished area, of which 6 million pounds were landed, providing an overall exploitation rate of 35 \%.}

Bayesian state-space modelling of the De Lury depletion model: strengths and limitations of the method, and application to the Moroccan octopus fishery. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1272--1290.The strengths and limitations of a Bayesian state-space modelling framework are investigated for a De Lury depletion model that accommodates two recruitment pulses per year. The framework was applied to the Moroccan fishery for common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) between 1982 and 2002. To allow identifiability, natural mortality (M) and the recruitment rhythm were fixed, and the variance of both process and observation errors were assumed to be equal. A simulation--estimation (SE) approach was derived to test the performance of the method. If the data showed responses to harvest, the estimates of the most important figures, i.e. the initial abundance and the second recruitment pulse, were accurate, with relatively small bias. Results confirm that greater depletion yields smaller bias and uncertainty and that inferences are sensitive to the mis-specification of M. The 21 depletion series in the Moroccan dataset were jointly treated in a hierarchical model including random walk to capture the systematic fluctuations in estimates of catchability and initial abundance. The model provides estimates of the annual recruitment and monthly octopus population size. The recruitment estimates could be used to investigate the link between recruitment variability and the coastal North African upwelling regime to improve understanding of the dynamics and management of octopus stocks.}

  abstract = {Stock identification research can be classified as an observational study, the main characteristic of sampling being that there is no opportunity to repeat the process under similar conditions. To obtain useful information with this limitation, several considerations can be outlined. Time and space sampling require intensive field work. It is necessary to repeat sampling over time (more than 1 year of sampling) to estimate temporal stability of the investigated patterns. The spawning season should also be considered in the sampling process to assure the homogeneity of spawning populations and identify the spawning grounds. The ideal situation would be to sample the whole species' distribution area making an a priori compromise between the effort and the biological information to be obtained. Inherent genetic variability of biological material is an important source of ecological variability. Therefore, performing all the different stock identification techniques on the same specimen reduces uncertainty when interpreting the results. The sampling logistics, taking into consideration the requirements of the different techniques applied, is a key-point in any stock identification project. We also considered the experience within the EU-funded project on horse mackerel stock identification research (HOMSIR), which has provided the chance to apply several techniques that play a key role in stock identification.},

  abstract = {Information on growth, reproductive biology and the distribution of commercial landings was considered in the EU funded project HOMSIR as basis for the initial recognition of management units for horse mackerel. Twenty sampling sites were considered, which covered the entire range of the species distribution. More than 4400 otoliths were aged and the length distributions at age of different sampling sites were compared. Horse mackerel showed great variability in growth although some patterns can be identified. The Mauritanian coast shows the highest median length at age. The increasing trend in median length at age according to the increment in latitude in two different areas (the Portuguese coast and along the west Ireland coast) suggests the possibility of a particular length-dependent migration pattern during the spawning season in these areas. In the Mediterranean, the horse mackerel in the Thyrrenian and the Ionean Seas showed the highest length at age values. The reproductive strategies of the horse mackerel were analysed using the maturity ogives and the batch fecundity. Maturity ogives were estimated in terms of length and age at first maturity. In the Atlantic, both the length and age at first maturity seem to decrease with decreasing latitude. In the Mediterranean, no similar tendency was evident between its western and eastern parts. Statistical differences between all areas were obtained in the analyses of both length (P {$<$} 0.0001) and age at first maturity (P {$<$} 0.05). Batch fecundity had a decreasing trend with latitude in the Atlantic. In the Mediterranean, data were obtained only from two areas: in Greek waters and off Southern Spain. The individuals from the latter had higher fecundity than those from Greek waters. Statistical differences were found between areas (F = 2.1377; P = 0.0346). The distribution of commercial landings in the northeast Atlantic showed that fish move from the south of Ireland to the Norwegian Sea and northern North Sea to feed in the autumn early winter.},

  abstract = {Horse mackerel stock identification was carried out with the aim of obtaining management units that were meaningful biological entities and thus improving the management of the resource. The stock identification was made by integrating both established and innovative approaches such as genetic markers (allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, microsatellite DNA and SSCP on nuclear DNA), morphometry, parasites as biological tags, and life history traits (growth, reproduction and distribution), within the EU-funded HOMSIR project. The sampling covered almost the whole distribution range of horse mackerel through 20 sampling localities in Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Horse mackerel showed low levels of genetic differentiation, stable genetic structure over the study time and high levels of genetic variability. However, several approaches (morphometrics and parasites) support the separation between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea in horse mackerel populations, although the most western Mediterranean area could also be mixed with the Atlantic populations. In the Northeast Atlantic, various stocks can be distinguished mainly based on morphometrics, parasites and life history traits: a ``southern'' stock is distributed along the West Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula south to Cape Finisterre (NW Spain); a ``western'' stock, along the west coast of Europe from Cape Finisterre to Norway and the ``North Sea'' stock. These results implied the revision of the boundaries of the southern and western stocks as previously defined. Results also suggested that adult horse mackerel could migrate through different areas following the west coasts in the Northeast Atlantic (i.e. between Celtic Seas and northern North Sea). Horse mackerel from the Mauritanian coast is distinguished by its high growth rate and high batch fecundity. Based on the results from morphometric analysis and the use of parasites as biological tags, the horse mackerel population in the Mediterranean Sea is sub-structured into at least three main areas: western, central and eastern Mediterranean. In this contribution, we have integrated the fundamental findings of different approaches showing that the holistic approach is the appropriate way to identify horse mackerel stocks, on covering multiple aspects of the biology of the species and reducing the type I error in stock identification.},

To address these needs, we present and compare alternative climate-informed multi-species statistical catch-at-age models to account for spatio-temporal differences in stock distributions, with application to four groundfish species (walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Gulf of Alaska, USA. We integrate across multiple forms of uncertainty regarding the data and distribution of Pacific halibut using an ensemble modelling approach. Models developed here can be used to supplement current tactical fisheries management and inform on the trade-offs between harvesting across groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska. This approach may be applicable for other situations where spatial and temporal overlap is extensive among closely coupled species.},

The average metal concentrations in liver, skin and muscle of female fish were found to be higher than those found in the male fish. The detected metal levels were generally similar to previous pre-war, 1991 levels. The study concludes that the marine fish from the Arabian Gulf are comparatively clean and do not constitute a risk for human health. ᮊ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Though anecdotal evidence and empirical experience lend support to the fact that this parameter may be difficult to estimate, the current literature lacks a theoretical justification. We first discuss the estimatability of a time-invariant M theoretically and present necessary conditions for a constant M to be identifiable. We then investigate the practical usefulness of this by estimating M from simulated data based on models fitted to 19 fish stocks. Using the same data sets, we next explore several model formulations of time varying M, with a pre-specified mean value. Cross validation is used to assess the prediction performance of the candidate models. Our results show that a time-invariant M can be estimated with reasonable precision for a few stocks with long time series and typically high values of the true M. For most stocks, however, the estimation uncertainty of M is very large. For time-varying M, we find that ac\- counting for variability across age and time using a simple model significantly improves the performance compared to a time-invariant M. No significant improvement is obtained by using complex models, such as, those with time dependencies in variability around mean values of M.},

  abstract = {The coastal waters off Western Iberia are an important fishing ground and a marine megafauna foraging area. Overlap between fishery target species and the diet of several air breathing marine megafauna species can lead to negative interactions and consequently conservation and economic issues. This work aimed to assess marine megafauna (cetaceans, marine birds, and marine turtles) -- fishery interactions through face-to-face interviews to fishers of the local and coastal artisanal fisheries fleets in the landing sites of the Portuguese mainland Southern coast (Algarve). The main goal was to identify and evaluate problematic interactions known to cause bycatch or economic loss through depredation. We found that bycatch is a concern for all marine megafauna groups, but depredation problems are mostly associated with cetaceans. Of the sampled artisanal fisheries (longlines, pots and traps, bottom set-nets, and purse seine), the fishing gears of most concern were purse seine and coastal bottom set-nets. Purse seine showed problems associated with important bycatch numbers, especially of common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, while bottom set-nets have considerable bycatch of all animal groups and depre\- dation was highly associated with bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. Bycatch and depredation were found to be species, gear, area, and vessel size dependent. Economic loss caused by depredation led to catch and gear damage and was widely reported by bottom set-net fishers, ranging from 7\% to 21\% of their revenue. Higher losses were reported for local vessels in leeward (eastern) Algarve area. This study showed that the active participation of fishers provides improved localized knowledge on interactions between local and coastal fish\- eries and marine megafauna, allowing for the definition of specific management and mitigation strategies.},

These fishes display large `boom and bust' cycles with great ecological as well socioeconomic consequences. Despite many internationally coordinated research efforts, sufficient knowledge about the drivers of SPF population dynamics and, particularly, the interactive effects of environmental and anthropogenic factors is lacking. The ecology and management of SPF were discussed in a symposium in Victoria, BC (Canada), attracting participants from 31 countries. This Theme Section consists of 22 research contributions providing fundamental insights into (1) the biology of SPF, (2) the drivers of SPF dynamics and (3) the socioeconomic impacts of SPF fisheries. Such insights are urgently needed for effective, ecosystem-based management of these highly variable fish populations. The symposium was an important catalyst for future, internationally coordinated research efforts to further advance our knowledge on the drivers of SPF population dynamics and the effective management of SPF fisheries.},

  abstract = {Two sampling methods, equal probability and probability proportional to x (ppx), were investigated in order to recommend an optimum sampling strategy for carrying out a discards survey in the Irish Sea. The objective of the survey, which took place from April 1997 to August 1998, was to estimate the quantity of {\textregistered}sh discarded at {\textasciimacron}eet level by Northern Ireland trawlers. Additional data collected from English and Spanish trawlers were used to test the generality of the results. Simple random, regression, ratio and ppx estimators were evaluated. The regression, ratio and ppx estimators use additional information on a variable x in order to improve the precision of the estimate of the variable of interest y and offer a potential improvement over the simple random estimator if there is a signi{\textregistered}cant correlation between x and y. In order to compare the various estimators, 1000 independent data sets were generated using a bootstrapping technique for both equal probability and ppx with replacement selection. When comparing the estimators three criteria were examined: (i) bias, if any, of the estimator; (ii) relative precision of the estimators; (iii) accuracy of the formula for the variance of the estimator. Linear relationships between potential x{\textpm}y combinations were assessed for signi{\textregistered}cance and the residuals about the {\textregistered}tted line examined. This was carried out for each country and gear type for the main commercial species individually and all species combined. Different estimators proved optimal according to the x{\textpm}y combination examined. In some instances the improvement in precision when using the ppx sampling method was marginal over the equal probability method. For the data sets used in this study the ppx scheme offered insuf{\textregistered}cient advantage over the simpler equal probability method to justify the greater complexity in implementing ppx. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The case study concerns a product of a canning factory based in Portugal and packed in aluminum cans. It is the first LCA of a processed seafood product made with the traditional canning method. The production of both cans and olive oil are the most important process in the considered impact categories. The production of olives contributes to the high environmental load of olive oil, related to cultivation and harvesting phases. The production of aluminum cans is the most significant process for all impact categories, except ozone depletion potential and eutrophication potential, resulting from the high energy demand and the extraction of raw materials. To compare to other sardine products consumed in Portugal, such as frozen and fresh sardines, transport to the wholesaler and store was added. The environmental cost of canned sardines is almost seven times higher per kilogram of edible product. The main action to optimize the environmental performance of canned sardines is therefore to replace the packaging and diminish the olive oil losses as much as possible. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by half when plastic packaging is considered rather than aluminum. Frozen and fresh sardines represent much lower environmental impacts than canned sardines. Nevertheless, when other sardine products are not possible, it becomes feasible to use sardines for human consumption, preventing them from being wasted or used suboptimally as feed.},

  abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} Common octopus is the fishing species with highest economic revenue in Portugal, and its consumption per capita is very high. The majority of catches come from the small-scale fleet with pots and traps. The aims were to assess main environmental impacts of common octopus' fishery with traps and pots in the Algarve region, where the most important fleet size and landings volume occurs, and to find if there are significant differences between both fishing gears. Methods{\enspace} The assessment includes standard LCA impact categories, fishery-specific impact categories, and quantification of macroplastics and microplastics emitted to the environment. The functional unit selected was 1 kg of octopus and the study was a `cradle to gate' system. The scope included fishing operations until the product is landed at the harbour. Primary data was obtained by face-to-face questionnaires from 22 vessels, with an average of 1005 pots and 1211 traps per vessel, and 372 pots and 234 traps lost annually to the environment. Plastic pots have a concrete block and traps are a metal framed covered by plastic netting. Each trap or pot is connected to the main line at regular intervals. Unlike traps, pots do not need bait. Results and discussion{\enspace} Fuel contribution to global warming is very high and where the highest potential exists to lower down the carbon footprint. The fuel use intensity resulted in 0.9 L/kg of octopus. The bait used in traps is significant and raises further environmental costs related with fuel consumption. The use of traps represents more than two times the impacts found for pots in all the categories studied except ecotoxicity categories. Zinc use was the main contributor to ecotoxicity categories, but it has not been included in other fishery LCA studies. It was estimated that 12.2 g of plastics is lost to the environment per kg of octopus. The loss of macroplastics from fishing gears was the highest contributor. Conclusions{\enspace} The carbon footprint obtained was 3.1 kg C\- O2 eq per kg of octopus, being lower compared to other seafood products, and less than half compared to octopus caught with trawling. Pots and traps are highly selective fishing gears, causing negligible disturbance to the seafloor. The stock is not assessed, but management measures exist and can be improved. A drawback exists related with gears lost to the environment.},

  author = {Amir, Omar A and Berggren, Per and Jiddawi, Narriman S},
  abstract = {The level of incidental catches of dolphins in artisanal gillnet fisheries was investigated in a questionnaire survey of 101 gillnet vessel operators from 10 villages in Unguja island of Zanzibar, representing half of all the gillnet fishing fleet in 1999. A total of 96 dolphins were reported to have been incidentally caught between 1995 and 1999; 43 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), 29 spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris), 5 IndoPacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and 19 unidentified dolphins. Most of these incidental catches (46) were reported in 1999. We extrapolate that 93 animals may have been incidentally caught by the entire fishing fleet (201 vessels) during 1999. This estimate represents a serious cause for concern, suggesting that the incidental capture of dolphins in Zanzibar's artisanal gillnet fisheries may be high enough as to have a significant negative impact on local populations. Further studies to accurately estimate the total bycatch, as well as the abundance of dolphin populations in the area are essential to assessing the biological significance of these incidental catches. However, management efforts should be implemented immediately to reduce the number of dolphins killed in these fisheries.},

  abstract = {Many marine species once considered to be cosmopolitan are now recognised as cryptic species complexes. Mitochondrial markers are ubiquitously used to address phylogeographic questions, and have been used to identify some cryptic species complexes; however, their efficacy in inference of evolutionary processes in the nuclear genome has not been thoroughly investigated. We used double digest restriction siteassociated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) markers to quantify species boundaries in the widely distributed and high value common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, comparing genome-wide phylogenetic signal to that obtained from mitochondrial markers. Phylogenetic analyses, genome-wide concordance and species tree estimation based on 604 genome-wide ddRADseq loci revealed six species within the O. vulgaris group. Divergence time estimates suggested modern-day species evolved over the last 2.5 ma, during a period of global cooling. Importantly, our study identified significant phylogenetic discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers; genome-wide nuclear loci supported O. vulgaris sensu stricto and Type III (South Africa) as distinct species, which mtDNA failed to recognise. Our finding of conflicting phylogenetic signal between mitochondrial and nuclear markers has broad implications for many taxa. Improved phylogenetic resolution of O. vulgaris has significant implications for appropriate management of the group and will allow greater accuracy in global fisheries catch statistics.},

The grey gurnard, Eutrigla gurnardus, frequently emits knock and grunt sounds during competitive feeding and seems to adopt both contest and scramble tactics under defensible resource conditions. Here we examine, for the first time, the effect of fish size on sound production and agonistic behaviour during competitive feeding. We have made sound (alone) and video (synchronized image and sound) recordings of grey gurnards during competitive feeding interactions. Experimental fish ranged from small juveniles to large adults and were grouped in four size classes: 10--15, 15--20, 25--30 and 30--40 cm in total length. We show that, in this species, both sound production and feeding behaviour change with fish size. Sound production rate decreased in larger fish. Sound duration, pulse duration and the number of pulses increased whereas the peak frequency decreased with fish size, in both sound types (knocks and grunts). Interaction rate and the frequency of agonistic behaviour decreased with increasing fish size during competitive feeding sessions. The proportion of feeding interactions accompanied by sound production was similar in all size classes. However, the proportion of interactions accompanied by knocks (less aggressive sounds) and by grunts (more aggressive) increased and decreased with fish size, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that smaller grey gurnards compete for food by contest tactics whereas larger specimens predominantly scramble for food, probably because body size gives an advantage in locating, capturing and handling prey.

  abstract = {The acoustic repertoire of captive grey gurnard               Eutrigla gurnardus               during competitive feeding consisted of three types of sound: knocks, grunts and growls. Knocks were audible as a single sound, whereas grunts and growls were perceived as longer, pulsed sounds to the human ear. Typically, knocks were composed of 1--2 pulses, grunts of 4--8 pulses and growls {$>$}10 pulses. Growls were longer and had shorter pulse periods than grunts. All sound types had peak frequencies of               c               . 500{$\quad$}Hz. The sequences of behaviours observed during feeding interactions suggest that grey gurnard obtain food both by scramble and contest tactics. Competing fish emitted knocks mainly while grasping a food item and also during other non-agonistic behaviour, suggesting that knock production may reflect a state of feeding arousal but could also serve as a warning of the forager's presence to nearby competitors. Grunts were mainly emitted during frontal displays, which were the most frequent behavioural act preceding grasps, suggesting that they may play a role in deterring other fish from gaining access to disputed food items.},

  abstract = {The acoustic repertoire of captive grey gurnard               Eutrigla gurnardus               during competitive feeding consisted of three types of sound: knocks, grunts and growls. Knocks were audible as a single sound, whereas grunts and growls were perceived as longer, pulsed sounds to the human ear. Typically, knocks were composed of 1--2 pulses, grunts of 4--8 pulses and growls {$>$}10 pulses. Growls were longer and had shorter pulse periods than grunts. All sound types had peak frequencies of               c               . 500{$\quad$}Hz. The sequences of behaviours observed during feeding interactions suggest that grey gurnard obtain food both by scramble and contest tactics. Competing fish emitted knocks mainly while grasping a food item and also during other non-agonistic behaviour, suggesting that knock production may reflect a state of feeding arousal but could also serve as a warning of the forager's presence to nearby competitors. Grunts were mainly emitted during frontal displays, which were the most frequent behavioural act preceding grasps, suggesting that they may play a role in deterring other fish from gaining access to disputed food items.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding how animals physiologically respond to capture and release from wild capture fishing is fundamental for developing practices that enhance their welfare and survival. As part of purse seine fishing for small pelagic fish in northern European waters, excess and/or unwanted catches are routinely released from the net in a process called slipping. Due to excessive crowding in the net prior to release, post-slipping mortality rates can be unacceptably high. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) support large and economically important purse seine fisheries but are known to be particularly vulnerable to such crowding-induced mortality. Developing management advice to promote post-slipping survival for this species is currently challenging, due to a lack of understanding of how crowding influences their physiology. Here we examine the physiological response, recovery and survival of wild caught mackerel exposed to various degrees and durations of simulated crowding stress in a series of sea cage trials. The magnitude of the physiological response and its time to recovery was positively correlated with crowding density and duration and was characterized by cortisol elevation, energy mobilization and anaerobic metabolite accumulation. There were also indications of osmoregulatory disturbance. Skin injury and mortality rates showed a similar positive relationship to crowding density. The physiological disturbance was recoverable for most fish. Instead, the rate at which mortalities developed and the physiological profile of moribund fish indicated that skin injury, likely arising from abrasive contact with netting and other fish during crowding, was the probable cause of mortality. Injured fish also exhibited a loss of allometric condition relative to non-injured survivors. Crowding treatments were potentially confounded by differences in ambient oxygen reduction, water temperature and pre-treatment fish condition between trials, and densities were replicated only once. These results contribute to the development of welfare conscious fishing practices that aim to reduce post-slipping mortality.},

  abstract = {Fisheries management is generally based on age structure models. Thus, fish ageing data are collected by experts who analyze and interpret calcified structures (scales, vertebrae, fin rays, otoliths, etc.) according to a visual process. The otolith, in the inner ear of the fish, is the most commonly used calcified structure because it is metabolically inert and historically one of the first proxies developed. It contains information throughout the whole life of the fish and provides age structure data for stock assessments of all commercial species. The traditional human reading method to determine age is very time-consuming. Automated image analysis can be a low-cost alternative method, however, the first step is the transformation of routinely taken otolith images into standardized images within a database to apply machine learning techniques on the ageing data. Otolith shape, resulting from the synthesis of genetic heritage and environmental effects, is a useful tool to identify stock units, therefore a database of standardized images could be used for this aim. Using the routinely measured otolith data of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa Linnaeus, 1758) and striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus Linnaeus, 1758) in the eastern English Channel and north-east Arctic cod (Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758), a greyscale images matrix was generated from the raw images in different formats. Contour detection was then applied to identify broken otoliths, the orientation of each otolith, and the number of otoliths per image. To finalize this standardization process, all images were resized and binarized. Several mathematical morphology tools were developed from these new images to align and to orient the images, placing the otoliths in the same layout for each image. For this study, we used three databases from two different laboratories using three species (cod, plaice and striped red mullet). This method was approved to these three species and could be applied for others species for age determination and stock identification.},

  abstract = {Fisheries studies often employ multiple gears that result in large percentages of zero values. We considered a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with random effects to address these excessive zeros. By employing a Bayesian ZIP model that simultaneously incorporates data from multiple gears to analyze data from the Missouri River, we were able to compare gears and make more year, segment, and macrohabitat comparisons than did the original data analysis. For channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, our results rank (highest to lowest) the mean catch per unit area (CPUA) for gears (beach seine, benthic trawl, electrofishing, and drifting trammel net); years (1998 and 1997); macrohabitats (tributary mouth, connected secondary channel, nonconnected secondary channel, and bend); and river segment zones (channelized, inter-reservoir, and least-altered). For shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, the mean CPUA was significantly higher for benthic trawls and drifting trammel nets; 1998 and 1997; tributary mouths, bends, and connected secondary channels; and some channelized or least-altered inter-reservoir segments. One important advantage of our approach is the ability to reliably infer patterns of relative abundance by means of multiple gears without using gear efficiencies.},

Potential system states of the KZN Bight were created by constructing multiple models in Ecopath with Ecosim, carrying out sensitivity analyses and comparing outputs. Sensitivity analyses showed that models were most sensitive to apex predator parameters and a comparison of outputs showed the important influence of riverine detritus on system functioning. To demonstrate the KZN Bight models could reproduce known differences to other ecosystems a comparison of the nutrient-poor KZN Bight to the nutrient-rich Southern Benguela was carried out. This confirmed that the KZN Bight was considerably smaller in biomass, productivity and fishery landings than the Southern Benguela with the systems being detritusdriven and phytoplankton-driven respectively. The KZN Bight relied on large detritus imports from rivers and had higher cycling through the system. The reliance on detritus import from rivers has riverine and fishery management implications as a decrease in riverine detritus caused a decrease in biomass of biotic groups, including targeted fishery species.},

  abstract = {There are two main types of models to assess the state of exploitation and determine the productivity of a fish stock, mainly depending on the detail of the basic data available: (i) production models that consider the stock globally and analyse the rate of variation of total biomass and (ii) the age-structured models that take into account the structure of the stock by age and analyse the evolution of the number of survivors of the different cohorts. The underlying mathematical models, basic assumptions and parameter vector are presented for each type of model. It is shown, using two important fisheries resources in Portuguese waters, the application of the Bayesian framework to infer about the values and uncertainty of the parameters of the model. The presentation focus on issues related to the choice of the likelihood function, the adoption of prior probability distributions that summarize the information on the parameters from all knowledge except that contained in the collected data and to the application of MCMC method, given the high dimensional integration required by the selected models, to obtain the posterior distributions for the parameters and derived quantities. The presentation is closed with remarks on sensitivity analysis to the choice of priors.},

  abstract = {The gooseneck barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) is a highly exploited species in Spain and Portugal due to the great commercial demand and the high prices in the market. Due to the inaccessibility of the Gaztelugatxe coastal area (Basque Country, Northern Spain), the gooseneck barnacle has maintained one of the greatest populations of the Basque coast in this area. Declared as a marine reserve by means of the 229/1998 (Basque Government) Decree, a 2 years moratorium in the gooseneck shellfishing was established. Facing the possibility of the gooseneck barnacle fishery opening in the area of the biotope, it was noticed the need for the development of a management tool, capable to think over the different management decisions: from the complete conservation of the system to the sustainable exploitation of the resource, joining together different social and biological factors, allowing the protection of the firsts (protection of the stock) and the development of the seconds (fishery activity). Based on the population dynamics of the gooseneck barnacle, a system dynamic model dominated by one positive and three negative loops was developed. The positive loop portrays the reproductive and maturation process, ultimately producing more adult gooseneck barnacles. The negative loops cause the stabilisation as the different stages of the population expire due by natural causes and exploitation of the resource. According to the model results, the best management decision is the maintenance of the moratorium. Taking into account the dispersion capability of larvae, other areas near the reserve, and subjected to commercial exploitation like Ogon{\texttildelow} o, Izaro and cape Villano, will benefit from the protection of Gaztelugatxe production. In the case of exploitation, the best management decision, which maximises captures and minimises the stock looses in a sustainable manner, is an alternate exploitation between Aketxe and Gaztelugatxe coastal areas of the marine reserve. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To the extent of our knowledge, this is the northernmost record of this species on the NE Atlantic coast. This species is the newest entry into a list of 23 aquatic and benthic exotic molluscs species from Galician waters. Most of them are introduced marine species, which arrived accidentally, or not, in the Galician region as a consequence of ship transport, shellfish culture and trade.},

  abstract = {Small pelagic fishes constitute most of the fish caught in the Mediterranean Sea and two thirds of the Lebanese landings. In this study, we present some biological parameters for the most common species collected during the fishing season. In Lebanon, juvenile pelagic fishes are attracted to floating lights and captured using purse seine nets. At least 32 species were collected but only 11 (mainly Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita and Scomber japonicus) represented most of the catches. Weight--length relationships and different condition indices for common species were calculated. Most landed fishes were juveniles with a mean size of 11.3 {\textpm} 8.8 cm TL. Fish conditions exhibited a similar temporal pattern with a minimum recorded in July, probably due to interspecific food competition in the nurseries. The monitored fishing vessel landed about 15 tonnes of juvenile fishes during the 4-month fishing season while fishing effort remained constant. Size-ranges and length--frequency distributions showed that the dominant sizes ranged between 6 and 8 cm TL and that harvested fishes are smaller than the minimum size fished in neighbouring Mediterranean countries. The Lebanese purse seine fishery targets 0 age-class juvenile of many fishes in the nurseries, which is against sustainable fishing practices and has a potential impact on pelagic fish communities in the eastern Mediterranean.},

  abstract = {Artisanal or small-scale fishery represents an important share of the Mediterranean fishery, even if it has been poorly investigated until now. In order to improve the knowledge on this sector we studied the Aeolian fishery, with the following aims: (a) to characterize fishery and fishing activities together with their socio-economic aspects; (b) to provide baseline information on the Aeolian fishery to develop appropriate management measures; (c) to discuss the changes in this fishery as a consequence of the implementation of EC Regulation 1239/98 concerning the conversion of boats that used ``spadara'' driftnet targeting swordfish.

In order to improve the knowledge on this sector we studied the Aeolian fishery, with the following aims: (a) to characterize fishery and fishing activities together with their socio-economic aspects; (b) to provide baseline information on the Aeolian fishery to develop appropriate management measures; (c) to discuss the changes in this fishery as a consequence of the implementation of EC Regulation 1239/98 concerning the conversion of boats that used ``spadara'' driftnet targeting swordfish.

Although age and growth studies predominated at the Symposium, new areas of quality-control assurance, annual-increment formation in deep-sea and tropical fish, image analysis and two-dimensional feature extraction were demonstrated. New statistical approaches were also evident, particularly in the subsampling of commercial data for estimating age compositions. The chemical composition of otoliths as natural data loggers has greatly advanced since the 1998 Symposium, with the advent of micromilling machines, new instrumentation and the use of isotopes rather than elements as environmental indicators. Otoliths will continue to support modern environmental needs for fisheries, marine park assessment, metapopulation conservation and the management of stocks and biodiversity of fish.},

  abstract = {Artisanal fisheries are generally assumed to generate a lower fishing effort in comparison to the industrial sector. This study aims to comparing catch, fishing effort, and catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) for each sector, using kWdays as a metric for fishing effort, and kg/kWdays for CPUE. The study, which covers West Africa (1950--2010), finds that the artisanal sector spends 4.7{$\bullet$}109 kWdays/year versus 1.3{$\bullet$}109kWdays/year by the industrial sector, due to increasing numbers and size of artisanal boats, which in Senegal and Ghana can exceed that of (smaller) industrial vessels. The artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010, in contrast to a decrease in the industrial effort since the 1990s, which points to the occurrence of Malthusian overfishing, a form of fishing that favors excess labor instead of capital. This analysis finds that the CPUE declined by 1/3 since 1950 driven by a strong decline in the artisanal CPUE, which is 11 times lower than industrial CPUE. This confirms other indicators of decline of fish populations. This study calls for the prioritization of artisanal fisheries, with regard to management and data availability, but also as an important but unregulated sector, which contributes to overexploitation of fish stocks that are vital for communities in West Africa.},

Fish were transported to be monitored in captivity for 28 days. Survival, scale loss, physiological and biological (weight, length) parameters were measured.

  abstract = {For the estimation of the stock biomass measured during hydroacoustic surveys it is necessary to take {\textregistered}sh samples. These samples should represent the length distribution and species composition of the {\textregistered}sh estimated by the sounder. Therefore the trawl has to catch every object in the volume of water sampled. To approximate this, the selectivity of the used trawl should be low. However, specially designed trawls are rarely available. Usually modi{\textregistered}ed commercial trawls are used. Two research vessels from Sweden and Germany carried out a co-ordinated survey, to investigate trawl catch composition of high {\textregistered}sh densities scattered layers of herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea. The analysis indicated that the selectivity for young {\textregistered}sh was different between trawls because of the different mesh sizes in the codend. Thus, there is a need to estimate the real size distribution. A correction function was designed by applying selectivity data obtained from commercial trawls. However, these corrections are only possible for data obtained with mesh sizes not much larger than the optimum size. Results of this study also indicated that the larger the trawl, the larger the proportion of larger {\textregistered}shes in the length distribution. This effect could not be explained by selectivity. Thus further research is necessary. In every case it is advisable to check the selectivity of the sampling trawl in the described way. \# 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The influence of intrusions of eastern North Atlantic central water (ENACW) in the north and northwestern Iberian shelf on phytoplankton composition and abundance and on particle-size distributions of seston was analyzed using data collected on three extensive cruises during spring 1991 and 1992. Water with temperature and salinity values between 12.20 and 13.86 jC and between 35.66 and 35.98 psu, respectively, characteristics of the subtropical type of ENACW (ENACWt), was detected in the upper 100 m of the water-column in all cruises, but particularly in the western coast in 1992. The highest salinity values of this water were found near the surface (0 -- 100-m depth) and in early spring 1992, while minimum salinity values, and also minimum geographical extension, were found in late spring in both years. Phytoplankton blooms concentrated in frontal areas between different water types, with maximum intensity and extension in early spring.},

  abstract = {Feeding on phyto- and zooplankton by juvenile ({$<$} 1 year old) and adult sardines (Sardina pilchardus) was inferred from analyses of natural abundance of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in samples from the northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Spain) collected at the beginning of the upwelling season and peak spawning period of sardine. Plankton samples were fractionated through nets of 20, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 {\textmu}m mesh-size and the muscle protein of individual sardines was isolated before isotopic determinations. Up to six planktonic components and two sardine feeding types were identified from the modes in the frequency distributions of isotope abundance values. Also, the most probable pathways for carbon and nitrogen flows between compartments were analysed. The resulting food web revealed a relatively large degree of omnivory, both in plankton and sardine components, which confirms that complex trophic interactions could also occur in pelagic upwelling ecosystems. Young sardines had isotope abundance values clustered around a single mode in the frequency distribution, while adult sardines displayed two main modes. These modes are interpreted as representative of two extreme feeding types: one related to the individual capture of zooplankton prey and the other to unselective filter-feeding. Although both types of feeding could include micro- (20-200 {\textmu}m) and mesozooplankton (200-2000 {\textmu}m) prey, phytoplankton appears to be ingested mainly by filter-feeding. However, even adult sardines must be mainly zoophagous to achieve the observed isotopic abundance values, taking into account current assumptions on stable isotope enrichment through trophic levels. From the differences in the resulting pathways using either carbon or nitrogen isotopes, we interpreted that sardines acquire most of the protein nitrogen from zooplankton while a substantial fraction of their carbon would derive from phytoplankton. These interpretations agree with the information available for this species on the gut contents and the anatomy of the filtering apparatus.},

  abstract = {Otoliths are a central information source for fish ecology and stock management, conveying important data about age and other life history for individual fish. Traditionally, interpretation of otoliths has required skilled expert readers, but recently deep learning classification and regression models have been trained to extract fish age from images of otoliths from a variety of species. Despite high accuracy in many cases, the adoption of such models in fisheries management has been slow. One reason may be that the underlying mechanisms the model uses to derive its results from the data are opaque, and this lack of legibility makes it challenging to build sufficient trust in the results. Here, we implement a deep learning model that instead of age predicts the location of annotation marks for each of the annuli. This allows an expert to evaluate the model's performance in detail. The quality of the annotations was judged by a panel of four expert otolith readers in a double-blinded randomized survey. Using a scale from 1 to 5, the generated marks received an average quality score of 4.22, whereas expert annotations received an average score of 4.33. By counting the marks to determine fish age, we obtained an agreement between expert and model annotations of 64\% on our test set, which running the model stochastically increased to 69\%. Stochastic sampling yields further benefits, including an explicit measure of the model's uncertainty, the post hoc likelihood of the different age classes for each otolith, and a set of alternative annotation sequences that highlight the structure of the annuli.},

The adult population was male dominated with a sex ratio of 1 female: 1{$\cdot$}2 males with the mean size of males and females being similar.

The lesser gurnard appears to exhibit similar life-history patterns to other triglid species in that it can be classified as a generalist. Generalistic life-history characteristics such as a fast growth rate, early sexual maturity at a relatively large size, a non-seasonal spawning pattern, feeding on a variety of prey organisms and the ability to inhabit various substrata could all contribute to it maintaining a high biomass on the Agulhas Bank.},

  abstract = {The black scabbardfish is a deep-sea teleost species with high commercial interest in the NE Atlantic. While it is caught by large offshore trawlers in the North of Europe, in the south it is captured by artisanal longlines. On the Portuguese continental slope, in the south of ICES Division IXa, a longline fleet has been engaged in the capture of black scabbardfish for more than 20 years. This paper reviews and analyses the features of this fishery from a temporal perspective based on information from different data sources. The fishery is based on the port of Sesimbra, where a family type fishing community strives to keep catches profitable without altering the artisanal features that characterizes the fleet. Although the fleet has experienced some technical improvements through time, the fishing operations and strategy have changed very little. Fishing occurs at particular areas on the slope, where individual vessels have their own fishing grounds. Annual landings surpassed 4,000 tonnes in the early 1990's, but decreased to nearly 3,000 tonnes and have remained at this level since 2000. The length structure of the landings was stable from 2000 to 2005, with a modal (total length) class of 1,090 mm.},

Long-term changes have also been observed in alongshore winds off Portugal in the last decades in winter months. During sardine spawning season (winter), northerly winds that favour upwelling led to unfavourable conditions for egg and larval survival. By using time series analysis, we investigated the effect of wind conditions and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the sardine catches, in the period from 1946-1991. We also investigated the time lag between recruitment strength and its turnout in catches. We concluded that recruitment is forced to a lower level when the frequency and intensity of northerly wind exceeds a certain limit in winter. Our time series retrospective analyses led to evidence of climatic driven regime-shifts in West Portugal sardine productivity in late 1960s-early 1970s. These results are discussed in terms of their implications in fisheries management plans.},

  abstract = {Decadal changes have been observed in the annual catch of sardine (Sardina pilchardus W). Long-term changes have also been observed in alongshore winds off Portugal in the last decades in winter months. During sardine spawning season (winter), northerly winds that favour upwelling led to unfavourable conditions for egg and larval survival. By using time series analysis, we investigated the effect of wind conditions and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the sardine catches, in the period from 1946-1991. We also investigated the time lag between recruitment strength and its turnout in catches. We concluded that recruitment is forced to a lower level when the frequency and intensity of northerly wind exceeds a certain limit in winter. Our time series retrospective analyses led to evidence of climatic driven regime-shifts in West Portugal sardine productivity in late 1960s-early 1970s. These results are discussed in terms of their implications in fisheries management plans.},

In the Basque Country (northern Spain) the small Marine Reserve of Gaztelugatxe (158 ha) was established in 1998. One of the aspects taken into account in protecting this area was the overexploitation of the goose barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes. Now, after five years of protection, differences in density, biomass, size and weight of the goose barnacle are investigated inside the protected area (Aketze and Gaztelugatxe locations) and outside of it, at the nearest locations (Izaro and Ogo{\~n}o) which have been continuously exploited. This contribution demonstrates that the reserve could be an efficient tool in preserving the goose barnacle populations in the area. Hence, density, biomass and allometric coefficients are higher in the protected areas. These locations are also associated with higher percentages of juveniles, together with a high number of large-sized individuals.},

This contribution provides information on the standing stock, and of the relationships between biomass, coverage, and density, and environmental factors such as wave height and energy derived from waves received at the coast. Increasing energy levels produce enhanced coverage and abundance, providing a bigger standing stock in the reserve. Numerical models to simulate the energy produced by waves can be used as a tool to predict the potential biomass of the goose barnacle along the coast. Such an approach allows comparison of observed and predicted biomasses, and possibly also determination of the factors involved in the observed differences, e.g. overexploitation and pollution; this will assist in assessing goose barnacle resources along the coast.},

Two popular and widely used methods are Catch-MSY (CMSY) and Surplus Production Model in Continuous Time (SPiCT). We apply these methods to 17 data-rich stocks and compare the status estimates to the accepted International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) age-based assessments. Comparison statistics and receiver operator analysis showed that both methods often differed considerably from the ICES assessment, with CMSY showing a tendency to overestimate relative fishing mortality and underestimate relative stock biomass, whilst SPiCT showed the opposite. CMSY assessments were poor when the default depletion prior ranges differed from the ICES assessments, particularly towards the end of the time series, where some stocks showed signs of recovery. SPiCT assessments showed better correlation with the ICES assessment but often failed to correctly estimate the scale of either F/FMSY of B/BMSY, with the indices lacking the contrast to be informative about catchability and either the intrinsic growth rate or carrying capacity. Results highlight the importance of understanding model tendencies relative to data-rich approaches and warrant caution when adopting these models.},

These two species were collected by trawl nets between February 2000 and July 2002 at depths ranging from 80 to 150 meters. In the laboratory the stomach contents were examined for diet assessment and to determine diet variation in relation to fish size, season and sex. The importance of different prey items was analysed utilising several feeding indexes, while diet overlap was tested using Schoener's index and the null model test. The two species showed similar diets, with the same qualitative and quantitative composition. Basic food consisted of crustaceans, mostly mysids and decapods. For Chelidonichthys lastoviza: Gastrosaccus sp.

  abstract = {The artisanal gillnet fishery around the Balearic Islands is experiencing a growing problem with bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus depredating the bottom-set nets. The resulting catch loss engenders hostility from fishers, and interactions between dolphins and nets can result in bycatch mortality. One potential mitigation measure is the placement of acoustic alarms, or pingers, on the nets. However, as pingers have produced mixed results in studies of their effectiveness in other fisheries, direct evidence is needed on whether they will be effective in this fishery. We report on a large-scale experimental trial in which 59 different vessels from the artisanal fleet were each equipped with identical nets, and each vessel was assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: no pinger, inactive pinger or active pinger. Three brands of pinger were tested. During the trial, data on fishing operations were recorded by onboard observers. A total of 1193 fishing operations were observed. We analysed 2 response variables, the presence or absence of evidence that dolphins had interacted with the net, and standardized yields, using generalized linear mixed models. Overall net interaction rates were reduced by 49\% with active pingers, but not all pinger brands were equally effective. Yields, measured as profit per unit effort, were increased by 9\% in the active-pinger condition, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.592). Our results suggest that pingers in the artisanal fisheries of the Balearic Islands reduced the rate of net interaction, but further study is required given dolphins' potential for habituation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             As the number of fish reproduction studies has proliferated, so has the number of gonadal classification schemes and terms. This has made it difficult for both scientists and resource managers to communicate and for comparisons to be made among studies. We propose the adoption of a simple, universal terminology for the phases in the reproductive cycle, which can be applied to all male and female elasmobranch and teleost fishes. These phases were chosen because they define key milestones in the reproductive cycle; the phases include immature, developing, spawning capable, regressing, and regenerating. Although the temporal sequence of events during gamete development in each phase may vary among species, each phase has specific histological and physiological markers and is conceptually universal. The immature phase can occur only once. The developing phase signals entry into the gonadotropin-dependent stage of oogenesis and spermatogenesis and ultimately results in gonadal growth. The spawning capable phase includes (1) those fish with gamete development that is sufficiently advanced to allow for spawning within the current reproductive cycle and (2) batch-spawning females that show signs of previous spawns (i.e., postovulatory follicle complex) and that are also capable of additional spawns during the current cycle. Within the spawning capable phase, an actively spawning subphase is defined that corresponds to hydration and ovulation in females and spermiation in males. The regressing phase indicates completion of the reproductive cycle and, for many fish, completion of the spawning season. Fish in the regenerating phase are sexually mature but reproductively inactive. Species-specific histological criteria or classes can be incorporated within each of the universal phases, allowing for more specific divisions (subphases) while preserving the overall reproductive terminology for comparative purposes. This terminology can easily be modified for fishes with alternate reproductive strategies, such as hermaphrodites (addition of a transition phase) and livebearers (addition of a gestation phase).},

  abstract = {In 1985, Boehlert (Fish. Bull. 83: 103--117) suggested that fish age could be estimated from otolith measurements. Since that time, a number of inferential techniques have been proposed and tested in a range of species. A review of these techniques shows that all are subject to at least one of four types of bias. In addition, they all focus on assigning ages to individual fish, whereas the estimation of population parameters (particularly proportions at age) is usually the goal. We propose a new flexible method of inference based on mixture analysis, which avoids these biases and makes better use of the data. We argue that the most appropriate technique for evaluating the performance of these methods is a cost--benefit analysis that compares the cost of the estimated ages with that of the traditional annulus count method. A simulation experiment is used to illustrate both the new method and the cost--benefit analysis.},

  abstract = {The eastern Australian stock of orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) is a deep-water, long-lived species with a history of considerable exploitation during the late 1980s and early 1990s before being reduced to around 10\% of unfished spawning biomass only a few years later, resulting in the closure of the fishery in 2006. Recent as\- sessments have shown an increase in biomass, and the fishery was re-opened to targeted fishing in 2015. The stock is an example of the consequences of over-exploitation and of managed recovery. As such, conservation groups and fisheries managers are very interested in the status and future of the stock. Consequently, the assessment is both contentious and highly scrutinised. The current assessment uses the Stock Synthesis platform, with key inputs being annual catches, occasional acoustic surveys and age-composition data. Natural mortality (M) has been fixed at 0.04 yr- 1 in the model on which management advice was based for several assessment cycles, but the maximum likelihood estimate of M is closer to 0.03 yr- 1. Reducing the assumed value for M would lead to large reductions in catch, as determined by the Australian harvest control rule. A prior for M was developed based on assessments of orange roughy stocks in New Zealand and included in a Bayesian analysis in which M was treated as an estimable parameter. The median of the posterior for M is 0.0353 yr- 1 when the maximum age in the assessment (i.e., the `plus-group age') is set to 80 years, but setting the plus-group age to 80 is not based on analysis of data. Increasing the plus-group age to 100 and 120 years leads to posterior medians for M of 0.0381 and 0.0393 yr- 1 respectively. This has consequences for catch limits under the Australian harvest control rule, with models that have older plus-group ages having higher estimated productivity and recom\- mended biological catches. The results highlight the value of making use of the results from assessments of similar species to develop priors for M, especially for species that are poorly represented in the data sets on which current meta-analyses are based, and for the need to consider the choice of plus-group age when conducting assessments, particularly for long-lived species.},

  abstract = {The beach seine fishery is performed regularly along the Portuguese coast in shallow water sandy areas. The catches and discards of this fishery were studied from March until November 1999, on the coast south of Lisbon. Fishing operations were monitored weekly and estimates of the weight of catches and discards per species were determined for each haul. A total of 60 fish species was identified in the catches but Scomber japonicus, Trachurus trachurus and Diplodus bellottii represented approximately 90\% of the catches. For most of the species the percentage of discarded fish was extremely high (ca. 100\%). The species for which the estimates of discards were lower than 25\% of the catches were Sardina pilchardus, Merluccius merluccius, Dicentrarchus labrax, Dicentrarchus punctatus, T. trachurus, several Sparidae species, Spicara maena, S. japonicus, Solea senegalensis, and Solea solea. Most of the species exhibited a marked seasonal abundance pattern that varied according to the species. Discards also varied considerably within and between seasons. The relationships between discards and total catch, species catch, mean length of fish and percentage of fish above minimum legal size were different according to species. For S. japonicus and S. pilchardus discards were negatively correlated with their catch, mean length of fish and percentage of fish above minimum legal size, while for T. trachurus significant correlations were obtained only for the last two variables.},

Assessment of the relative importance of anthropogenic versus naturally induced fluctuations is made difficult by the range of natural short-term variations. For the Tagus case study, multivariate ordination techniques, rather than the ranking methods and indices analyzed, provide a good indicator of long-term changes. The major trends in the changes observed in this fish community were a decrease in abundance for several species that use the estuary as a nursery area and an increase in some resident species, namely Gobius spp. and Halobatrachus didactylus. Several species with southern European affinities have increased their importance within the Tagus estuarine fish community.},

  abstract = {For data-limited stocks (DLS), professional fishing data can be used as a potential source of information, especially in the absence of appropriate scientific survey, to understand abundance evolution under realistic hypothesis on resource catchability. This work focuses on a data-filtering approach, the selected fishing effort must reflect vessel activity that is least dependent on their technical characteristics and as stable as possible over time. The variable of interest is landing by fishing sequence (landing for a given gear, gear mesh, day and ICES statistical rectangle) called LPUE. In order to account for the abundance of the species, it was necessary to consider the discards. The method thus proceeds in 4 steps: (i) focus on LPUE variability and causes' prioritization; (ii) cluster definition to obtain a typology of vessels; (iii) average LPUE per cluster analysis; (iv) consideration of gear mesh classes and seasonal variations (quarters). This approach is outlined for the Striped red mullet of the Bay of Biscay that is currently in DLS category 5. Two reference fleets are thereby proposed: firstly the otter trawlers composed of small vessels (7.9--15.8 m) with a gauge of 2--43.9 grt, an engine power between 44 and 256 kW and a gear mesh of 70--79 mm; secondly the set gillnetters, which are defined by medium-sized vessels (8.2--14.8 m, 2--30.2 grt, 70--331 kW) whose gear mesh is either 50--59 mm (2nd and 3rd quarters), 60--69 mm (2nd quarter) or greater than 90 mm (2nd quarter). LPUEs of these fleets show a downward trend, significant in two out of four cases which may reflect a deterioration of the status of the Striped red mullet stock.},

  abstract = {Many calcified structures produce periodic growth increments useful for age determination at the annual or daily scale. However, age determination is invariably accompanied by various sources of error, some of which can have a serious effect on age-structured calculations. This review highlights the best available methods for insuring ageing accuracy and quantifying ageing precision, whether in support of large-scale production ageing or a small-scale research project. Included in this review is a critical overview of methods used to initiate and pursue an accurate and controlled ageing program, including (but not limited to) validation of an ageing method. The distinction between validation of absolute age and increment periodicity is emphasized, as is the importance of determining the age of first increment formation. Based on an analysis of 372 papers reporting age validation since 1983, considerable progress has been made in age validation efforts in recent years. Nevertheless, several of the age validation methods which have been used routinely are of dubious value, particularly marginal increment analysis. The two major measures of precision, average percent error and coefficient of variation, are shown to be functionally equivalent, and a conversion factor relating the two is presented. Through use of quality control monitoring, ageing errors are readily detected and quantified; reference collections are the key to both quality control and reduction of costs. Although some level of random ageing error is unavoidable, such error can often be corrected after the fact using statistical (`digital sharpening)' methods.},

To rigorously compare the sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of these four analytical tools, the International Otolith Composition Experiment distributed blind-labelled real and artificial otoliths of known but varied elemental composition to eight laboratories for assay of 10 selected elements. No one instrument type was sensitive to each element, nor was any one instrument preferred for use in all assays. In general however, abundant elements such as Na and K could only be measured accurately with an electron microprobe, while the trace elements required PIXE or LA-ICPMS. Strontium could be measured with considerable accuracy and precision by WD-EM, PIXE, and LA-ICPMS. The presence of significant, and occasionally large, differences among laboratories suggests that comparisons among published studies should be made cautiously and only after appropriate calibration.},

  abstract = {Speci{\textregistered}c trace elements incorporated into the growing surface of the {\textregistered}sh otolith re{\textasciimacron}ect the physical and chemical characteristics of the ambient water, although not necessarily in a simplistic manner. Since {\textregistered}sh which spend at least part of their lives in different water masses often produce otoliths of different elemental composition, the otolith elemental composition (`elemental {\textregistered}ngerprint') can serve as an environmentally induced tag of groups of {\textregistered}sh. On the basis of isotope dilution ICPMS (ID-ICPMS) assays of nearly 2500 dissolved adult cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, it has become clear that cod otolith elemental {\textregistered}ngerprints based on the elements Li, Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba are physically stable, reproducible and consistent between left and right otoliths. Highly signi{\textregistered}cant differences existed among the {\textregistered}ngerprints of all of the spawning aggregations, resulting in a characteristic marker for each aggregation. Long-term stability (4{\textpm}13 years) of the {\textregistered}ngerprints for a given spawning group was not evident, indicating that the {\textregistered}ngerprint was not a proxy for genetic identity. However, the {\textregistered}ngerprint was very stable over the short-term (up to 1 year), suggesting that it could serve as a seasonally stable biological tracer, or natural tag, of pre-de{\textregistered}ned groups of {\textregistered}sh, even during situations of extensive stock mixing. As an illustration of the tracer approach, a maximum likelihood-based stock mixture analysis was applied to feeding (summer) and over-wintering stock distributions, using the {\textregistered}ngerprints of the spring spawning aggregations as known-stock reference samples. The results of the summer stock mixture analyses suggested that the mixture analysis was accurate within 1\%, while the stock mixture analysis of the over-wintering schools produced stock-speci{\textregistered}c distributions which would have been dif{\textregistered}cult to obtain using alternative approaches. While the use of elemental {\textregistered}ngerprints as natural tags is not suited to all stock mixing situations, suitability can probably be determined beforehand on the basis of existing environmental and biological information. \# 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {A review of 862 otolith-oriented papers published since the time of the 1998 Otolith Symposium in Bergen, Norway suggests that there has been a change in research emphasis compared to earlier years. Although close to 40\% of the papers could be classifed as `annual age and growth' studies, the remaining papers were roughly equally divided between studies of otolith microstructure, otolith chemistry and non-ageing applications. A more detailed breakdown of subject areas identified 15 diverse areas of specialisation, including age determination, larval fish ecology, population dynamics, species identification, tracer applications and environmental reconstructions. For each of the 15 subject areas, examples of representative studies published in the last 6 years were presented, with emphasis on the major developments and highlights. Among the challenges for the future awaiting resolution, the development of novel methods for validating the ages of deepsea fishes, the development of a physiologicallybased otolith growth model, and the identification of the limits (if any) of ageing very old fish are among the most pressing.},

  abstract = {Temporal variation in natural mortality (M) has been recognized for having a degrading effect on the perfor\- mance of stock assessment models when it is not accounted for in the model. However, time-invariant M has remained widely practiced in stock assessments due to the difficulties in estimation. Therefore, in this study we conducted simulation-estimation experiments to (1) evaluate the ability of a size-structured assessment model to reliably estimate time-varying M as well as other population quantities, and (2) quantify the consequences of mis-specifying M in a size-structured assessment model. We modified an existing size-structured assessment model to include three different approaches to estimate time-varying M within the model. A wide range of scenarios regarding the underlying M patterns (variation over time and length) was considered in this study. The performance of estimation methods largely depends upon whether the assumption of length-dependent/independent M was correctly specified in the assessment model. Among the three methods, estimating timevarying M as a mean (representing an average process) and time-specific deviations using auxiliary informa\- tion performed best. Estimating time-varying M as a random walk process also performed well except when underlying time-varying M had large year-to-year variation. A temporal pattern in M affected the ability of the assessment model to provide reliable estimates of M, spawning stock biomass and recruitment. Assuming a constant M (i.e., fixing M at the correct value) was quite robust over a range of actual temporal variation in underlying M.},

It aims to provide guidelines to standardize the current methods used in fish ageing studies and it gives an overview of the general principles on which age analysis relies (assignment of birth date, preparation methods, aging scheme reading and identification of true and false rings). The volume provides information on extraction and storage, preparation methods, age interpretation and ageing criteria by species, analysing a total of 30 species. As such, it represents one of the most complete outlooks on fish ageing analysis in the Mediterranean context. Fish age, among other biological parameters, is one of the most relevant pieces of data in reaching sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. Indeed, most analytical methods used in stock assessment require knowledge of demographic structure according tot he age of stocks, as well as to recruitment, growth, maturity, natural mortality, etc., which are strictly linked to information on age and age structure. The literature on ageing analysis shows some gaps regarding agein schemes, criteria and methodologies used in preparing calcified structures. These aspects affect both the precision and accuracy of age estimation. One action that could be taken to overcome this gap was to formalize a handbook that clarified approaches to ageing schemes, criteria and preparation methods. Having a common protocol is indeed fundamental to decreasing bias associated with the activities of age determination and to improving precision in age reading"--Back cover},

  abstract = {Pelagic fish stocks in the Java Sea have been exploited intensively since the beginning of the 1970s. However, due to the effect of increased fishing power of the fleets and the changing nature of spatial and temporal distribution of the fishing effort, assessment of stock trends based on commercial data of catch and effort requires the standardization of both effort and catch data. Here we present the first attempt to reconstruct a standardized time series of commercial catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for the main pelagic species exploited by the purse seine fleet in the Java Sea. The results showed that all the stocks analysed have largely declined since the beginning of the 1990s. For bigeye scad, Indian mackerel and sardine, current estimates are only between 3 and 19\% of the maximum observed value while round scads and spotted sardine biomass estimates lie between 18 and 34\%. However, our assumptions about the effect of lamp power and level of creeping and the fact that the influence of fish density on catchability and the effect of targeting were not taken into account thus observed decline is a rather conservative estimate of the real decline of the stocks. If effective management actions are not put in place as a matter of urgency in the Java Sea for small pelagic fisheries, one runs the risk of adding those species to the long list of overexploited stocks of the world oceans.},

  abstract = {The recent failure of sardine catches off Galicia (NW Spain), an area where landings reached up to 100 thousand tonnes only a few years ago, may be explained by two possible hypotheses. The ``depletion'' hypothesis states that diminishing sardine catches were due to a decrease in stock biomass resulting from a combination of reduced recruitment and increased fishing mortality. The ``change in distribution'' hypothesis states that catch failure was due to a change in the distribution of the stock owing to environmental changes. Available information, based on direct observations from acoustic and ichthyplankton surveys and the fishery, was analysed. When the stock size is high, the spawning area of the sardine extends offshore in the Cantabrian Sea, and spreads along the continental shelf off northern Portugal. Moreover, adult fish undertake feeding migration towards Galician waters. This spawning behaviour results in a recruitment located mainly off Portugal. Low stock size causes a shrinkage in the distribution area throughout coastal waters and in the Cantabrian Sea, reaching the inner part of the Bay of Biscay. This process also affects the migration range and favours a higher retention in coastal waters of the early life stages (from eggs to recruits), which remain primarily in the same area where they were hatched. The lack of sardine in Galicia may be explained by a depletion process which affects both the feeding migration of adult fish and the recruitment occurrence off southern Galicia. This paper also analyses the dynamics of this stock in the context of a metapopulation. Taking this concept into consideration, we also examined the influence of the dynamics of each sub-population and the environmental conditions that might affect the success of the recruitment.},

  abstract = {The interaction between fishing gears and the marine environment define `fisheries,' and the effect of gears on marine ecosystems and fish stocks has been the source of much debate. Here, we present the first summary of globally reconstructed fisheries catches by major gear categories for 1950--2014. We used the Sea Around Us reconstructed global catch database that accounts for reported and unreported fisheries catches, and associated all catches to a fishing gear category. We assigned all industrial (i.e., large-scale) fisheries catches to industrial gear categories by fishing country, taxon, year and the area of fishing. Additionally, we derived catches by individual small-scale gear types for the most-important small-scale fishing countries in each of nine regions around the world, and applied their gear use to similar countries in each of the regions, to serve as a preliminary small-scale catch-by-gear assignment that can be improved upon over time. The combination of these account for gear use for all marine fisheries globally. We found that two industrial gear types, bottom trawling and purse seining, jointly account for over 53\% of all catches, while bottom trawling alone dominated discarded catches. In the small-scale sector, over 60\% of catches were caught by gillnets, various line gear, and encircling nets. Smallscale fisheries contributed most to the value of landed catches, while industrial bottom trawlers were responsible for discarding large amounts of potentially valuable catches. Catches by purse seines fluctuated over time, mainly due to variability of the underlying species, e.g., anchovies and sardines. The distribution and scale of use of different fishing gears, combined with knowledge of their divergent environmental impacts should allow a new wave of research into the global impacts of fisheries.},

A surface occupation index was used to measure the space covered by sardine. These descriptors were then related to catch, fishing effort, and catch per unit effort (cpue). We found that the greater the distance between the schools and the smaller the surface occupation index for schools, the smaller their size, biomass, and density. However, these descriptors were weakly related to the number of schools. The annual catch, fishing effort, and cpue were significantly and directly related to surface occupation index and inversely with the distance between schools. These fishery indices were weakly related to school area, school density, and school biomass. The change in the space occupied by sardine affected their catchability, as shown by the logarithmic relationship between the cpue and the acoustic biomass. The lack of linearity can be corrected by taking into consideration the index of surface occupation of the stock so as to produce a corrected cpue (cpue*) value, which is directly proportional to stock biomass.},

The chemical composition was compared statistically between areas within size groups and between size groups within areas by ANOVA and a Support Vector Machine method, using 10-fold cross-validation. The element composition of sardine otoliths was similar to that of other marine fish. In all, eight elements (Li, Ba, Mg, Mn, Na, Sr, K, and Ca) were useful in discriminating between areas and/or size groups. Discrimination between areas within size groups was less effective for the biggest size group (67\%) than for the middle (89\%) or smallest size groups (84\%). Discrimination between size groups within areas was better for GC (76\%) and GV (84\%) than for OCN (60\%). The results are interpreted in terms of a net balance of migration of large sardine from OCN towards GV and GC.},

This study provides a comprehensive description of the beam trawl fishery, in the North of Portugal. The target species of this study is the prawn, Palaemon serratus. The Ap{\'u}lia (Esposende) coastal fishing area was selected as sampling area, to characterize beam trawl prawn fishery. Sixteen surveys were conducted on board of commercial boats. The technical description of the fishing gear was made along with the design of the net. Between October 2001 and March 2002, 51 fishing days (28,1 \% of the total recorded days) were registered. During the 16 surveys, 93 hauls were made with an average duration of 18.5 minutes. A total of 24 species were caught by beam trawl, but only 11 species were landed. The target species represented about 77 \% of the total landings in weight. The by-catch of this fishery is not significant, except for the pouting (Trisopterus luscus). The target species was separated on board according to its commercial category, 1st choice, 2nd choice and discards. The composition of prawns catch in weight was 33 \% 1st choice, 20 \% 2nd choice and 47\% discards. Length frequency distributions were obtained for samples for the three categories of prawns. Females outnumbered males in the 1st choice category (54,7 \%). Conversely, in the other two categories, 2nd choice and discards, females only represented 19,0 \% and 24,4 \%, respectively.The carapace length varied between 7 and 22 mm for all categories and for both genders.

So far, histological features such as the prevalence of cortical alveoli or yolk granules are conservatively used to distinguish oocytes in different developmental stages which do not necessarily correspond to different cohorts. In this way, valuable information about spawning dynamics remains unseen and consequently misleading conclusions might be drawn, especially for species with high spawning rates and increased overlapping among oocyte cohorts. We introduce a new method for grouping oocytes into different cohorts based on the application of the K-means clustering algorithm on the characteristics of cytoplasmic structures, such as the varying size and intensity of cortical alveoli and yolk granules in oocytes of different development. The method allowed the grouping of oocytes without the need of using oocyte diameter, and thus, a crucial histological bias dealing with the cutting angle and the orientation of reference points (e.g. nucleus) has been overcome. Using sardine, Sardina pilchardus, as a case study, the separation of cohorts provided new insight into the ovarian dynamics, indentifying successive recruitment of up to five oocyte cohorts between SGO recruitment and spawning. These results verified previous histological indications of the number of cohorts in sardine. Altogether, this method represents an improved tool to study species with complex ovarian dynamics.},

Slipping is the release of unwanted capture in purse seining, by lowering the head rope of the net and rolling over the fish back into the water. In Southwestern Portugal (Sesimbra), during the summer of 2020, the experiment was carried out using 2 small net pens (control and slipping treatment) moored in the open ocean, where fish slipped by a purse-seiner were monitored daily to evaluate the survival rate of chub mackerel. The control pen contained fish slipped in the initial moments of slipping (less crowding and density), and the slipping treatment contained fish aggregated at high densites towards the end of the operation. The results of this experiment revealed a high survival rate of chub mackerel on both net pens, reaching 94\% in the slipping treatment and 97.7\% in the control, after a 5 day trial period. For horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), unintentionally introduced inside the nets, this study revealed a reduced survival rate of 40\% in the slipping treatment compared to 85\% in the control net, suggesting that the slipping activity for this species could induce high motalities. In this study, individuals' condition factor and caudal indexes, as well as physical conditions were evaluated during the experiment. It was verified that, for both species and for both control and slipping treatment, dead individuals, in general, presented more deterioration of these conditions, compared to the survivors. This work aims to evaluate the survival rate of chub mackerel and horse mackerel after purse seine slipping. This work is novel for both species, thus we expect this new knowledge, will be an important contribution to improve stock assessment of these species.},

Regarding the reproductive cycle, the identification of the maturity stages is made macroscopically during biological sampling. The maturity stage key currently in use at IPMA and applied to blue whiting is of the one suggested by Godinho et al.

This study aims to microscopically describe the morphology of the gonads throughout the reproductive cycle for blue whiting, to validate and intercalibrate the macroscopic identifications based on histology and also to propose a new macroscopic maturity stage key taking into account the microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of the different stages from the sexual development cycle.},

The independent and dependent variables in the model are length (or age) and the corresponding arcsin-square-root transformed proportion of mature fish (P{\textasciitilde}). The two parameters in the model are length (or age) at 50\% maturity (L50 or A50) and instantaneous rate of maturation (K). A simulation study was conducted to examine the statistical behaviour of the proposed model in estimating L50 and K. The L50 was well estimated with a small bias ({$<$}1\%) using the proposed model in all simulation cases. The K was well estimated (bias {$<$} 1\%) when its true value and the variance in P{\textasciitilde}were small. The proposedmodel was found to have relativelysmallerbias than the probit and Lysack's methods in estimating L50 (or A50). To examine whether there are significant differences in maturation patterns between different groups of fish, we propose fitting the maturation data to the proposed model, and then conducting an analysis of residuals sum of squares to test whether there are significant differences in the fitted models.},

  abstract = {We propose a two-parameter logistic type model for estimating fish length and age at 50 \% maturity using the nonlinear least-squares method. The independent and dependent variables in the model are length (or age) and the corresponding arcsin-square-root transformed proportion of mature fish (P{\textasciitilde}). The two parameters in the model are length (or age) at 50\% maturity (L50 or A50) and instantaneous rate of maturation (K). A simulation study was conducted to examine the statistical behaviour of the proposed model in estimating L50 and K. The L50 was well estimated with a small bias ({$<$}1\%) using the proposed model in all simulation cases. The K was well estimated (bias {$<$} 1\%) when its true value and the variance in P{\textasciitilde}were small. The proposedmodel was found to have relativelysmallerbias than the probit and Lysack's methods in estimating L50 (or A50). To examine whether there are significant differences in maturation patterns between different groups of fish, we propose fitting the maturation data to the proposed model, and then conducting an analysis of residuals sum of squares to test whether there are significant differences in the fitted models.},

  abstract = {Marine life is being affected by changes in ocean conditions resulting from changes in climate and chemistry triggered by combustion of fossil fuels. Shifting spatial distributions of fish species is a major observed and predicted impact of these oceanographic changes, and such shifts may modify fish community structure considerably in particular locations and regions. We projected future range shifts of pelagic marine fishes of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas by 2050 relative to the present. We combined published data, expert knowledge, and pelagic fish survey data to predict current species distribution ranges of 28 fish species of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas that occur in the epipelagic zone and are well-represented in pelagic fish surveys. These represent a wide spectrum of sub-tropical to sub-polar species, with a wide range of life history characteristics. Using projected ocean condition changes from three different Earth System Models, we simulated changes in the spatial distribution of each species. We show that Northeast Pacific shelf seas may undergo considerable changes in the structure of its pelagic marine communities by mid-21st century. Ensembles of model projections suggest that the distribution centroids of the studied species are expected to shift poleward at an average rate of 30.1 {\textpm} 2.34 (S.E.) km decade{\`A}1 under the SRES A2 scenario from 2000 to 2050. The projected species range shifts result in a high rate of range expansion of this group of species into the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. Rate of range contraction of these species is highest at the Aleutian Islands, and in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We also predict increasing dominance of warmer water species in all regions. The projected changes in species assemblages may have large ecological and socio-economic implications through mismatches of co-evolved species, unexpected trophic effects, and shifts of fishing grounds. These results provide hypotheses of climate change impacts that can be tested using data collected by monitoring programmes in the region.},

Fish were subjected to long-term (i) food deprivation, (ii) exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, (iii) hypoxia, respectively. Fish growth (fork length and body weight) and scale increments (circulus number and radius length) were measured. Results of Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between scale increment and growth for the red drum (fast growing) and the marine medaka (small sized) (r = 0.741--0.882, p b 0.001). For the slow growing orange-spotted grouper, a significant correlation was found only between body weight and circulus number (r = 0.406, p b 0.05). Overall, scale circulus number is more consistently linked to fish growth than that of radius length. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that daily circulus deposition on scales of fast-growing red drum is feasible to indicate daily growth of the fish. Moreover, scale increment exhibited the strongest correlation with fish growth as compared to that of serum T3 level and muscle RNA:DNA ratio. Our data support the use of scale increment as a means of indicating fish growth and growth impairment, particularly for the fast growing fish.},

Reproductive biology and sexual patterns of S. japonicus (chub mackerel) were examined from monthly random samples of commercial catches from purse seine nets (10 mm stretched mesh size) in the eastern Adriatic Sea. The annual mean chub mackerel fork length (FL) was examined from 1998 to 2007. Average fork lengths were approximately 25 cm between 1998 and 2002, decreasing to 22 cm between 2003 and 2007. In addition, sex ratios fluctuated as a function of size and month: females were more abundant in the smaller length classes, as well as before and after spawning; males were more abundant in the larger length classes and during spawning. The overall sex ratio was 0.68; females were significantly predominant. 50\% of the chub mackerel population was sexually mature at a FL of 18.3 cm, and both males and females reached sexual maturity at FLs of 20.4 cm and 16.8 cm, respectively. Based on gonad maturity stages, gonad weight and gonadosomatic index, chub mackerel spawned from May to August, with peak spawning in June for both sexes. The mean absolute fecundity was 181 277 {\textpm} 62 090 oocytes per ovary. A positive exponential correlation was found between fecundity and fork length, gonad weight, and total chub mackerel weight (r2 = 0.640; r2 = 0.686 and r2 = 0.607, respectively).},

The allocation of observed trips into clusters with similar catch composition (landings and discards) is a useful procedure for the analysis of discarding levels of trips within each cluster and to understand the motives associated to those discard levels. In general, results indicate that Iberian discard rates are highly variable being low in some specific fisheries, but moderate to high in most trips. Although a high number of species is caught in these fisheries only few contribute to 95\% of total weight of catch. The main discarding motives identified are related to market forces and regulations. This work shows that no one-fits-all solution exists to the minimization of discards in Iberian trawlers and discusses an array of possible discard mitigation measures, namely the implications of the recently proposed EU-wide discard ban.},

  abstract = {To date, most researchers have used dietborne metal concentrations rather than daily doses to define metal exposure and this has resulted in contradictory data within and between fish species. It has also resulted in the impression that high concentrations of dietborne Cu and Zn (e.g.)900 mg kgy1 dry diet) are relatively non-toxic to fish. We reanalyzed existing data using rations and dietborne metal concentrations and used daily dose, species and life stage to define the toxicity of dietborne Cu and Zn to fish. Partly because of insufficient information we were unable to find consistent relationships between metal toxicity in laboratory-prepared diets and any other factor including, supplemented metal compound (e.g. CuSO4 or CuCl2), duration of metal exposure, diet type (i.e. practical, purified or live diets), or water quality (flow rates, temperature, hardness, pH, alkalinity). For laboratory-prepared diets, dietborne Cu toxicity occurred at daily doses of )1 mg kgy1 body weight dy1 for channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), 1--15 mg kgy1 body weight dy1 (depending on life stage) for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and 35--45 mg kgy1 body weight dy1 for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We found that dietborne Zn toxicity has not yet been demonstrated in rainbow trout or turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) probably because these species have been exposed to relatively low doses of metal (-90 mg kgy1 body weight dy1) and effects on growth and reproduction have not been analyzed. However, daily doses of 9--12 mg Zn kgy1 body weight dy1 in laboratory-prepared diets were toxic to three other species, carp Cyprinus carpio, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, and guppy Poecilia reticulata. Limited research indicates that biological incorporation of Cu or Zn into a natural diet can either increase or decrease metal bioavailability, and the relationship between bioavailability and toxicity remains unclear. We have resolved the contradictory data surrounding the effect of organic chelation on metal bioavailability. Increased bioavailability of dietborne Cu and Zn is detectable when the metal is both organically chelated and provided in very low daily doses. We have summarized the information available on the effect of phosphates, phytate and calcium on dietborne Zn bioavailability. We also explored a rationale to understand the relative importance of exposure to waterborne or dietborne Cu and Zn with a view to finding an approach useful to regulatory agencies. Contrary to popular belief, the relative efficiency of Cu uptake from water and diet is very similar when daily doses are compared rather than Cu concentrations in each media. The ratio of dietborne dose:waterborne dose is a good discriminator of the relative importance of exposure to dietborne or waterborne Zn. We discuss gaps in existing data, suggest improvements for experimental design, and indicate directions for future research. ᮊ 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Plasma E2 and T increased again as GSI began to increase prior to the next spawning season. Maximum hepatosomatic index (HSI) occurred in association with gonadal recrudescence. HSI decreased significantly as the spawning season progressed and showed a significant but irregular increase as recrudescence occurred prior to the following spawning season.},

As part of cooperative scientific efforts for fisheries and biological data collection, information from fishery observers, scientific projects and surveys, and from recreational fisheries from several nations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans was compiled. Data sets included information on location, size and sex, in a total of 478,220 blue shark records collected between 1966 and 2014. Sizes ranged from 36 to 394~cm fork length. Considerable variability was observed in the size distribution by region and season in both oceans. Larger blue sharks tend to occur in equatorial and tropical regions, and smaller specimens in higher latitudes in temperate waters. Differences in sex ratios were also detected spatially and seasonally. Nursery areas in the Atlantic seem to occur in the temperate south-east off South Africa and Namibia, in the south-west off southern Brazil and Uruguay, and in the north-east off the Iberian Peninsula and the Azores. Parturition may occur in the tropical north-east off West Africa. In the Indian Ocean, nursery areas also seem to occur in temperate waters, especially in the south-west Indian Ocean off South Africa, and in the south-east off south-western Australia. The distributional patterns presented in this study provide a better understanding of how blue sharks segregate by size and sex, spatially and temporally, and improve the scientific advice to help adopt more informed and efficient management and conservation measures for this cosmopolitan species.},

  abstract = {This study presents the results of an analysis of data on length, weight maturity stage, and fecundity of the squid Loligo vulgaris. The data are based on monthly sampling, between January 1991 and June 1992, from the landings of a traditional inshore fishery for squid in southern Portugal. Male squid generally have a lower weight than females of equivalent mantle length. The overall ratio of male to female squid is 1.1, with limited periods during autumn and spring when females outnumber males. Mature males occur within the broad size range 115--605 mm, whilst mature females have a more restricted size range within 175--345 mm. Immature stages I--II dominate the population during June and July, and there is progressive maturation of both sexes stage II to mature squid at stage V, between August and the following March and May in the larger males and females, respectively. There is a significant difference between the sizes at which the different sexes achieve maturity (ML50\%), with the male at 245 mm and the female at 227 mm. There is evidence that there are two size modes at which males achieve sexual maturity. It is suggested that maturation of this species takes approximately 8 months in the Algarve. A range of reproductive indices derived from gonad morphometrics in mature squid show a pattern of seasonal development with overall values for gonad maturation indices which are lower during the summer and higher during the autumn to the spring. Fecundity has been estimated by counting the total number of oocytes and ova in the ovary and oviduct of mature (stages IV--V) females. The number of eggs varied between 1441 and 14886 and fecundity was correlated positively with mantle length, body weight, and with length and weight of the nidamental gland.},

  abstract = {Underestimation of catches is especially important in countries where fishing fleets are highly diversified, the enforcement of fishery management is low, data availability is poor, and there is high demand for fish products in local markets. This is the case for southern European and Mediterranean regions. Adapting a catch-reconstruction approach, we estimated the total removals of marine resources by Spain for the Spanish Mediterranean Sea and Gulf of Cadiz regions from 1950 to 2010. We collected available information from scientific publications, the grey literature and secondary sources of information to complement officially reported catch data. We assessed missing catch sectors as time-point estimates, used as anchor points of reliable data upon which we then estimated total catch using interpolation to fill in the periods for which quantitative data were missing. Unreported removals and discards represented important portions of total removals in the study area. They accounted for, on average, 43\% of total removals between 1950s and 2010, and were composed of black market sales, subsistence fishing, artisanal fishing, recreational fishing and illegal catch, in addition to discarding. By the late 2000s, recreational fishing was the most important sector for unreported landings ({$\sim$}36\%), followed by black market sales ({$\sim$}32\%), subsistence fishing ({$\sim$}17\%), unreported artisanal fishing ({$\sim$}12\%) and illegal catch ({$\sim$}2\%). The overall catch trend differed from the official trend highlighting that the depletion of marine resources in the region started earlier than previously observed. The catch composition changed with time, with a higher diversification of species in fish markets with time. These results indicate an earlier trend towards expansion of fisheries and depletion of marine resources.},

  abstract = {The horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus is a pelagic fish from the Carangidae family that is distributed in waters of Nororiental Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea. This species is of special interest due to its Atlantic--Mediterranean distribution and because of the possible effect of past and present day restrictions to gene flow between these seas. Although pelagic marine fishes generally show little geographical genetic differentiation, some species (and other marine organisms as molluscs and crustaceans) show genetic variation between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. To study this possible genetic differentiation, 359 individuals belonging to five Atlantic and four Mediterranean samples (eight along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula and one from the Gulf of Cagliari---south of Sardinia) were sequenced for 363 bp of the 5 -end of the mtDNA control region. From those individuals, 143 different haplotypes were identified. Only three of 143 haplotypes were present in all the samples, but with low frequencies (between 0.02 and 0.21), and each sample was almost exclusively represented by a unique group of haplotypes. Estimates of the degree of interpopulational genetic variation were low and not significant which indicates an absence of genetic variation between samples. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and the nested clade analysis also showed no genetic differentiation between samples and between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. The genetic homogeneity of the Atlantic and Mediterranean horse mackerel populations is discussed in comparison with previous studies of genetic variation in Trachurus and with regard to their life cycle and migratory capacity.},

These were compared with climatological temperature cycles (1986--2002) derived from satellite observations, by geographical region, to predict spawning seasons. Optimum spawning temperatures were determined as 14.0--15.0{$^\circ$}C from the English Channel to Portugal and 16.0--18.0{$^\circ$}C for all north-west African regions. Spawning seasons were closely related to the general latitudinal trend of the annual temperature cycle, with modification by upwelling in the western Iberian and north-west African regions. Some differences between temperature-based spawning season predictions and field observations were related to variations in seasonal plankton production. Correlations in the annual time-series of favourable spawning temperatures suggested relatively strong linkages between the southern areas from Portugal to Senegal. There was no consistent relationship between annual variations in extent of temperature-predicted spawning seasons and observed field abundance of eggs.},

  abstract = {Natural morality (M) is a notoriously difficult population parameter to estimate, yet it is also one of the most important measures of life history that sets, as Beverton and Holt called it, "the course of events". Stock as\- sessments that include this parameter often show great sensitivity to its value, reflecting the need to characetrize the uncertainty inherent in its estimation. Direct measurement of natural mortality is often limited to resource intensive tag-recapture studies. Indirect measures are more often used, and are built on life history theory, relating natural mortality to traits such as age, size, maturity and reproductive condition (or just assuming 0.2). The Natural Mortality Tool attempts to accumulate several empirical estimators of M into one application. Users simply input life history values to obtain estimates of natural mortality. These estimates can be taken individ\- ually or can be combined into a weighted density function that can be used to develop an M prior that integrates uncertainty across several estimates. Comparing estimators can also reveal inconsistencies in life history values that may lead to further refining of basic biological understanding. Two examples are used to demonstrate tool functionality and highlight general recommendations on implementation. Making these estimators and the development of uncertainty in estimating natural mortality more widely available hopefully supports transparent and defensible decision-making on the treatment of this important population parameter.},

In this study otolith elemental fingerprints (both whole and core) of juvenile recruits (ages 0+ and 1+) and adults (age 3+) collected along the Portuguese coast (North, Central and South regions) were used to demonstrate regional population structure. The whole and otolith core analyses represented the entire life-history prior to capture and the larval/recruitment phases (first 2 months of life), respectively. Molar ratios of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca and Ba/Ca provided location-specific elemental signatures, although otolith elemental compositions were not temporally stable within a year-class, particularly for Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca. Classification accuracy rates obtained from quadratic discriminant function analysis of core and whole otolith chemistry data of adults were relatively high (63\% and 79\% mean accuracy percentages, respectively). The results support the hypothesis of meta-population structure of the sardine stock in the Atlanto-Iberian waters. However, because there was evidence of some mixing among adult aggregations, and adult aggregations were largely derived from a common northern juvenile recruitment area they cannot be classified as entirely separate stock units for fisheries management purposes. The maximum likelihood analysis suggested for the 2004 cohort that replenishment of adult populations of sardine along the Portuguese coast was mostly derived from a single northern recruitment area.},

Age determination was done by counting the annual growth rings on otoliths from 3301 individuals. The studied fish showed a range of lengths from 16 to 49 cm (mean length of 29.7 cm) with ages between 0 and 15 years old (mean age of 2.8 years). The mean lengths at age were also found, corresponding to 20.5 cm for age 0 and 26.0 cm for age 1. No differences in the von Bertalanffy growth parameters between sexes were found but statistical differences were recorded between years. The length-weight relationships pointed to a positive allometric growth (b {$>$} 3.0) and statistical differences were found between sexes and among the five years. The information achieved in this study was compared with the data for mackerel from other geographic areas of the NE Atlantic. The results provide additional information on the growth of this species in the less studied part of the southern stock component - the Portuguese continental waters.},

  abstract = {The Tagus is the largest estuary in Portugal (320 km2). Its fish community is composed of 44 species, with species diversity values varying between 0.85 and 2.237. Seven fish species use the estuary as a nursery area: Trisopterus luscus (Linnaeus, 1758), Ciliata mustela (Linnaeus, 1758), Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus, 1758). Trigla lucerna Linnaeus, 1758, Platichthys flesus flesus (Linnaeus, 1758), Solea vulgaris vulgaris Quensel, 1806, and Solea senegalensis Kaup, 1858. While in the estuary, their growth rate is very high. This may be related to the availability of suitable food items. The brown shrimp Crangon crangon (Linnaeus, 1758) also uses the estuary as a nursery, and is a prefered prey of T. lucerna, D. labrax and C. mustela, and a secondary prey for S. vulgaris and P. flesus. The main food of these last two species are two polychaete species, Nereis diversicolor Miiller, 1852 and Lanice conchilega Pallas, 1778. Three shallow water stations near highly productive salt-marshes are the principal nursery areas for fishes. Young of the year D. labrax were caught first in nursery areas in May with a minimum standard length of 25 mm. The first catches of Solea vulgaris occurred in April, when juveniles had a standard length of 30 mm. The highest density was observed in May with 142.3 ind. 1000 m-1. Density values of Solea senegalensis were lower.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is crucially important for stock assessment since it strongly influences estimates of spawning stock biomass, MSY and fishing mortality. Variation in M can occur between sexes, maturity stages and temporally. Estimates of M are confounded with those of catchability, recruitment, and growth. Previous studies, which focused on age-structured population dynamics models, suggest that it would be better to estimate M rather than pre-specify it. Size-structured population dynamics models, used for species that are hard to age such as crabs, have unique characteristics such as a size-transition matrix and the possibility of a terminal molt, which could impact the ability to estimate M. Therefore, this study explores the ability of size-structured stock assessment models to estimate M for several scenarios. These scenarios include whether the operating model and estimation method have a terminal molt, whether M is constant, time-varying, or sex- and maturity stagespecific, the quality/sample size of the biomass index and the size-composition data and whether growth is estimated simultaneously with M. The results show that size-structured models can estimate time-varying, sexand maturity stage-specific M when the estimation method mirrors the operating model. Surprisingly, terminal molt does not affect the ability to estimate M. However, estimating growth simultaneously with M has a negative impact on the ability to estimate M but a positive effect on the quality of the estimates of spawning stock biomass.},

The model is applied to the European sardine fishery in which, furthermore, the countries implied introduce different management measures in their fishery jurisdiction. The results show that setting fishing periods in order to reach the proposed TAC reduces the risk of over-exploitation of the resource. Also, the global profits are reduced but the cost of reducing the risk of overexploitation is not spread out equally among the countries which participate in the fishery. Portugal incurs the costs of introducing limits on the number of fishing days and Spain obtains the profits obtained from the maintenance of greater stock levels.},

  abstract = {Triggered by a recent interesting New Scientist article on the too frequent incorrect use of probabilistic evidence in courts, I introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic inference with a toy model, and discuss several important issues that need to be understood in order to extend the basic reasoning to real life cases. In particular, I emphasize the often neglected point that degrees of beliefs are updated not by `bare facts' alone, but by all available information pertaining to them, including how they have been acquired. In this light I show that, contrary to what claimed in that article, there was no ``probabilistic pitfall'' in the Columbo's episode pointed as example of ``bad mathematics'' yielding ``rough justice''. Instead, such a criticism could have a `negative reaction' to the article itself and to the use of Bayesian reasoning in courts, as well as in all other places in which probabilities need to be assessed and decisions need to be made. Anyway, besides introductory/recreational aspects, the paper touches important questions, like: role and evaluation of priors; subjective evaluation of Bayes factors; role and limits of intuition; `weights of evidence' and `intensities of beliefs' (following Peirce) and `judgments leaning' (here introduced), including their uncertainties and combinations; role of relative frequencies to assess and express beliefs; pitfalls due to `standard' statistical education; weight of evidences mediated by testimonies. A small introduction to Bayesian networks, based on the same toy model (complicated by the possibility of incorrect testimonies) and implemented using Hugin software, is also provided, to stress the importance of formal, computer aided probabilistic reasoning.},

  abstract = {Data-limited methods are being developed rapidly to cater to a range of data types and stock characteristics. One class of these methods is catch-only methods (COMs), which seek to determine stock status based largely, or exclusively, on catch histories. Although catch data are the most common information for a fishery, they are susceptible to large errors. Understanding the performance of COMs when catch is mis-specified is necessary before they can be used in fisheries management. This study constructed a simulation-estimation framework to evaluate the performance of two types of COMs, Catch-MSY (CMSY) and catch-only boosted regression trees (zBRT), in inferring stock biomass status (B/BMSY) with consideration of different forms of catch errors, fishing patterns, and prior information. The results showed both COMs tended to bias the estimates of B/BMSY regardless of types of catch errors. The estimation performance of COMs was robust to the constant reporting rate across all fishing patterns, which means constant catch over- or under-reporting would not affect the COM assessment. zBRT showed high sensitivity to fishing patterns and performed best when fishing mortality was constant. CMSY yielded underestimation in most cases, but use of a narrow and informative prior on final depletion improved accuracy in recent years. Neither COM performed well in correctly identifying categorical biomass status (overfished vs. not overfished) across assessment years. We caution that improving catch quality would not improve the estimation of COMs and do not advocate for the application of COMs due to their poor performance.},

The results showed that both species used the freshwater, the upper and lower estuarine habitats. There was a strong difference in the level of contamination of eel compared to flounder, with higher levels of PCBs, copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) in eel. The differences of contamination between muscle and liver were also specific to the considered species. The choice of the river habitat at an early age seemed to increase the risk of exposure to PCBs. The results suggested that the use of the upper estuary was related to a higher level of copper for both species and of PCBs for the flounder. The higher level of liver cadmium was measured for fish spending the longer time in the lower estuary. {\'O} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {As part of its scientific objectives, the Federation of Maltese Aquaculture Producers (FMAP) organised and carried out its first growth trial in a cage of one of its members in order to determine the increase in weight and length of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus)(BFT). The growth trial, which lasted from February to June 2009, used approximately 300 bluefin tuna from the 2008 fishing season. The average sea temperature during the experiment was 17oC. Other measurements were taken at each sampling point, as were samples for further analyses (chemical, histological and genetic). From an average round weight (RWT) of 60.9kg the bluefin tuna grew to an average RWT of 87.4 kg, an increase of 43.5\%. Fork length (FL) increased from an average of 142.5cm to an average of 157.9 cm by the end of the trial period, an increase of 10.8\%. The results obtained here clearly indicate a significant growth in farmed bluefin tuna even at the low average temperature of 17oC. The data presented here, along with other data and indicators available, should be used to update stock assessments incorporating more realistic input RWT figures from bluefin tuna farms.},

The exercise was made up of two steps applied to datasets from 14 representative fish stocks from around the world. Step 1 involved applying stock assessments to datasets with varying degrees of effort dedicated to optimizing fit. Step 2 was applied to a subset of the stocks and involved characteristics of given model fits being used to generate pseudo-data with error. These pseudo-data were then provided to assessment modellers and fits to the pseudo-data provided consistency checks within (self-tests) and among (cross-tests) assessment models. Although trends in biomass were often similar across models, the scaling of absolute biomass was not consistent across models. Similar types of models tended to perform similarly (e.g. age based or production models). Self-testing and cross-testing of models are a useful diagnostic approach, and suggested that estimates in the most recent years of time-series were the least robust. Results from the simulation exercise provide a basis for guidance on future large-scale simulation experiments and demonstrate the need for strategic investments in the evaluation and development of stock assessment methods.},

The parameters of the logistic selectivity model were estimated by maximum likelihood. Length at 50\% retention, L50, was found to increase with mesh size for both species. The L50 values of 44, 56 and 80 mm were, respectively, 19.8, 21.5 and 33.4 cm for European hake, 17.9, 17.7 and 25.6 cm for tub gurnard. The main conclusions are that 44 mm and 56 mm diamond mesh codends retain a considerable amount of undersized hake and tub gurnard as by-catch in the shrimp fishery. With 80 mm mesh size codend, most juvenile European hake are released. For the tub gurnard, however, even this mesh size does not provide a good enough selection. From the biological point of view, it is concluded that the legal 44 mm diamond mesh codend does not provide satisfactory selection for European hake and the tub-gurnard in trawl fisheries of the Sea of Marmara.},

In 10\% of the fishing sets, there were interactions with one of three species of cetaceans: common dolphin (                                            Delphinus delphis                                          ), bottlenose dolphin (                                            Tursiops truncatus                                          ), and harbour porpoise (                                            Phocoena phocoena                                          ). The common dolphin was the most frequently observed species, occurring in 89\% of all interaction events, and the only species with observed mortality. Therefore, this study focused only on the interactions with common dolphins.                                                                                             A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to observer data to investigate how the fishing activity and the abundance of small pelagic fish influenced the probability of occurrence of interactions between the common dolphin and the purse seine fishery between 2003 and 2018. The results revealed significant annual and geographic variation in the occurrence of interactions, and a significant influence of fishing effort and catch per unit effort of sardine (                                            Sardina pilchardus                                          ).                                                                                             A second GAM in a hurdle model was used to model the number of common dolphins that interacted with the fishing activity as a function of fishing seasonality and the local abundance of pelagic fish. There was a significant effect of the seasonality of the fishing activity and catch per unit effort of sardine and chub mackerel (                                            Scomber colias                                          ) on the number of common dolphins interacting with the fishery.                                                                        The results of this study suggest that the probability of interactions and the number of common dolphins interacting with the fishery were affected by the local abundance of sardine and chub mackerel.                                                     As the common dolphin population appears to be increasing in the study area, the risk of by-catch also increases, thus the monitoring of the Portuguese purse seine fishery is important to inform the implementation of management plans, and also as a response to global efforts for sustainable fisheries and marine mammal conservation.},

  abstract = {Bivalves leave behind articulated valves when they die that can be used to estimate natural mortality. However, a common method used to estimate natural mortality in bivalves, known as the box count method, includes several assumptions that may be violated for eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. We developed a Bayesian model alternative to the box count method that included modifications to account for potential violations of assumptions. The model was applied to oysters in 32 areas in Maryland during 1991--2017 using dredge survey data, and the natural mortality estimates from the model were compared to ones derived from the box count method. The spatial and temporal trends in natural mortality from the model were sum\- marized using dynamic factor analysis. Natural mortality showed considerable spatial and temporal variation, with median mortality rates ranging between 0.00 and 0.96 yr- 1. Natural mortality spiked in most regions in 2002 and was lower in more recent years. The Bayesian model estimated slightly higher (0.02 yr- 1 on average) natural mortality than the box count method, except for years following high natural mortality, after which the Bayesian model estimated lower natural mortality than the box count method. The dynamic factor analysis revealed two common trends in natural mortality and a north-south gradient in the loadings on the trends. This work improves our understanding of the variability of oyster natural mortality in Maryland and the Bayesian model could be modified for use with oysters in other regions or with other species.},

  abstract = {The P{\'e}lagiques Gascogne (PELGAS) integrated survey has been developed by a multidisciplinary team of Ifremer and La Rochelle University scientists since 2000, joined by commercial fishermen in 2007. Its initial focus was to assess the biomass and predict the recruitment success of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay in spring. Taking advantage of the space and versatility of R/V Thalassa II, sampling has been progressively extended to other ecosystem components. PELGAS therefore further developed the second objective of monitoring and studying the dynamic and diverse Biscay pelagic ecosystem in springtime. The PELGAS survey model has allowed for the establishment of a long-term time-series of spatially-explicit data of the Bay of Biscay pelagic ecosystem since the year 2000. Main sampled components of the targeted ecosystem are: hydrology, phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, fish and megafauna. The survey now provides two main ecosystem products: standard raster maps of ecosystem parameters, and a time series dataset of indicators of the Bay of Biscay pelagic ecosystem state. They are used to inform fish stock and ecosystem-based management, and support ecosystem research. The present paper introduces the PELGAS survey, as a practical example of an integrated, vessel-based, ecosystem survey. The evolution of the PELGAS scientific team and sampling protocols are presented and analysed, to outline factors crucial to the success of the survey. Data and results derived from PELGAS are reviewed, to exemplify scientific questions that can be tackled by integrated ecosystem survey data. Advantages and challenges of the survey are discussed and put into the context of marine ecosystem surveys in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Common Fisheries Policy.},

  abstract = {Although highly variable in time and space, predation remains the greatest source of mortality for juvenile and lower trophic-level fishes. As such, predation can have substantial and long-term effects on the dynamics of these prey. Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) has shown considerable variability in biomass over the past four decades. During this same time, the demersal fish community transitioned from being dominated by pollock to a system comprised primarily of upper trophic-level predators. We estimated time-varying predation mortality to better understand its effects on the population dynamics of pollock in this currently ``top heavy'' system. Our index of predation accounted for spatiotemporal variation in predator biomass, bioenergetics-based rations, and age-specific proportions of pollock consumed (1990--2019). To evaluate population-level impacts of predation, we included an index of removals as part of the stock assessment model. This formulation allowed for non-annual data inputs and included a proportionality constant with which to scale predation. Age-specific natural mortality was allowed to vary according to a penalized random walk. We found that natural mortality ranged from 37\% higher to 17\% lower than the long-term mean. Resulting estimates of total pollock biomass differed by as much as 37\% relative to a model without time-varying natural mortality, though the maximum difference for exploitable biomass was only 14\%. Using an empirically-derived predation index to modify con\- stant natural mortality allows stock assessment scientists to evaluate impacts of time-varying predation on assessed species. This approach provides a relatively simple way of incorporating ecological information into single-species stock assessments and may reduce bias compared to conventional models that do not account for changes in predation mortality. Notably, including predation mortality in single-species assessments may help identify inconsistencies in biomass estimates that warrant further consideration.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

During these migrations sea turtles are subject to many threats, among which are interactions with pelagic longlines.                                                                          This gear is used frequently in the summer period in the Gulf of Gabes targeting mainly the sandbar shark (                     Carcharhinus plumbeus                     ). Hooks are baited with mackerel (                     Scomber scombrus                     ) or pieces of stingray (                     Dasyatis pastinaca                     ).                                                                        Twenty-one fishing trips (48 sets with a total of 35\,950 hooks deployed) were conducted using onboard observers in the south of the Gulf of Gabes during the months of July, August and September in 2007 and 2008. Stingray and mackerel bait were used in 19 and 29 sets, respectively.                                                                          In total, 29 loggerhead sea turtles (                     Caretta caretta                     ) were captured; the majority of them were juvenile and active. Turtles were caught at a statistically greater frequency on sets with hooks baited with mackerel than on sets with hooks baited with pieces of stingray.                                                                        The type of bait also affected the catch of the target species by increasing the efficiency when pieces of stingrays were used.                                                     These results encourage further research into new baits to mitigate turtle catch by longline fisheries without affecting the catch of target species.

More than 60\% of the fleet landing at Gaza city that has the only fishing port in the Strip. Annual catch fluctuated during the study period starting by the maximum at 1997 (2915 tonnes) and reaching the minimum at 2001 (1248 tonnes). Landing was affected by sardine catch fluctuation which was the most important and target species that has two fishing seasons; during April- June and Sept-October. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the purse seine launch ranged from 148 to 570 kg/day/boat, while for purse seine Hassaka ranged from 122 to 339 kg/day/boat. Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) was calculated for Sardinella aurita as 4099 tonnes with corresponding fishing effort (fMSY) equal 41900 fishing day. Results suggested that sardine stock is underexploited; moreover the catch can be doubled by applying suggested recommendations.},

The b value for males (b = 2.455) was somewhat lower than that for females (b = 2.642), showing negative allometry. The oldest male and female were estimated to be three years old. Total (Z), natural (M) mortality, fishing (F) mortality were 0.94, 0.64, 0.30 per year, respectively. The exploitation ratio E = 0.32 indicated that the population was slightly exploited. The sex ratio was skewed in favour of females (1:1.31).

Univariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between means of the samples for most morphometric and meristic descriptors. The contribution of each variable in distinguishing between the stocks for the first discriminant function revealed high contribution from head size measurements for morphometrics, and first and second dorsal fin rays for meristics. Plotting all specimens on the first two discriminant functions accounted for 76\% of total variance for morphometric and 69\% of total variance for meristic analyses, and both plots resulted in two main groupings.

These me{\textasciiacute}tiers were: cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and soles (Solea senegalensis, Microchirus azevia, Synaptura lusitanica) in the Algarve and the Gulf of Ca{\textasciiacute}diz, sole (Solea solea) in the Cantabrian Sea and mixed fin-fish in the Cyclades. In each area, experimental trammel nets of six different types (combinations of two large outer panel mesh sizes and three small inner panel meshes) were constructed. Fishing trials were carried out on a seasonal basis (four seasons in the Cantabrian Sea, Algarve and Cyclades and two seasons in the Gulf of Ca{\textasciiacute}diz) with chartered commercial fishing vessels. Overall, size selectivity was estimated for 17 out of 28 species for which sufficient data were available. Trammel nets generally caught a wide size range of the most important species, with length frequency distributions that were skewed to the right and/or bi-modal. In many cases the length frequency distributions of the different nets were highly overlapped. The Kolmogorov--Smirnov test also showed that the large outer panel meshes generally had no effect in terms of size selectivity, while the opposite was true for the small inner panel ones. Six different selectivity models (normal scale, normal location, gamma, log-normal, bi-modal and gamma semi-Wileman) were fitted to data for the most abundant species in the four areas. For fish, the bi-modal model provided the best fits for the majority of the data sets, with the uni-modal models giving poor fits in most cases. For Sepia officinalis, where trammelling or pocketing was the method of capture in 100\% of the cases, the logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood was judged to be more appropriate for describing the size selective properties of the trammel nets. Our results, which are among the first ones on trammel net selectivity in European waters, will be useful for evaluating the impacts of competing gear for the socio-economically important small-scale static gear fisheries.},

Here, we analyzed a 10-year (2002--2011) dataset from logbooks of European tropical tuna purse-seine vessels operating in the tropical Eastern Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans, with the aim of identifying the principle environmental variables under which such co-occurrence appear. We applied a Delta-model approach using Generalized Additive Models (               GAM               ) and Boosted Regression Trees (               BRT               ) models, accounting for spatial autocorrelation using a contiguity matrix based on a residuals autocovariate (               RAC               ) approach. The variables that contributed most in the models were chlorophyll-a concentration in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as depth and monsoon in the~Indian Ocean. High co-occurrence between whale sharks, baleen whales and tuna purse-seine fisheries were mostly observed in productive areas during particular seasons. In light of the lack of a full coverage scientific observer on board program, the large, long-term dataset obtained from logbooks of tuna purse-seine vessels is highly important for identifying seasonal and spatial co-occurrence between the distribution of fisheries and megafauna, and the underlying environmental variables. This study can help to design conservation management measures for megafauna species within the framework of spatial fishery management strategies.},

  abstract = {The acquisition of age and growth data is of key importance for fisheries research (assessment, marine ecology issues, etc.). Consequently, automating this task is of great interest. In this paper, we investigate the use of statistical learning techniques for fish age estimation. The core of this study lies in the definition of relevant image-related features. We rely on the computation of a 1D representation summing up the content of otolith images within a predefined area of interest. Features are then extracted from this non-stationary representation depicting the alternation of seasonal growth rings. Thus, fish age estimation can be viewed as a multi-class classification issue using statistical learning strategies. In particular, a procedure based on demodulation and remodulation of fish growth patterns is used to improve the generalization properties of the trained classifiers. The experimental evaluation is carried out over a dataset of 320 plaice otolith images from age groups 1--6. We analyze both, the performances of several statistical classifiers, namely SVMs (support vector machines) and neural networks, and the relevance of the proposed image-based feature sets. In addition, the combination of additional biological and shape features to the image-related ones is considered. We reach a rate of correct age estimation of 88\% w.r.t. the expert ground truth. This demonstrates the relevance of the proposed approach for the automation of routine aging and for computer-assisted aging.},

  abstract = {This study describes the communicational reality between purse seine fishermen and scientists, and explores the issues which divide them or those that unite them. The nature of the Common Fisheries Policy and the context of the Portuguese fisheries sector, with purse seine fishing in particular, demonstrate the changes occurring in Portugal as it undergoes integration into the European Union. Portuguese fishermen and scientists occupy different worlds, and communication between them is largely limited to the scientific information released by the National Institute for Agriculture and Fisheries (IPIMAR), and to occasional meetings which are held at this institute. The fishermen are not aware of any need to share their knowledge, and little use is made of such information. A successful coming together of these two groups occurred in 1997, when it became necessary to implement a plan of action concerning sardine resources. However, the concerns of the fishermen differ from those of the scientists; for the former, lack of manpower and problems related to commercialisation are the central questions, whilst the latter wish to monitor the behaviour of the stock in order to aid decision making at management level. Between these quite different cultures it is natural that the language used is also different, a consequence of which is the fact that the information given to the fishermen is often misunderstood. The data presented in this study were obtained at the beginning of 2004, and the results show that a constructive dialogue between scientists and fishermen is possible, but only if the information flows in mutually-understood language, and where both parties have something to gain by the sharing of information.},

  abstract = {The purse-seine fishery is the most important Portuguese fishery, accounting for 55\% of total landings by weight in 2019 (DGRM, 2020), targeting small pelagic species primarily sardine (Sardina pilchardus). With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its yields with chub mackerel (Scomber colias), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). In 2019, major landings were split between these four species, mainly chub mackerel (57\%) and sardine (14\%). Ten years ago, the main species was sardine (80\%) and chub mackerel percentage was equivalent to present-day of sardine. To minimize landings of low-value or unmarketable fish and maximize the value of their overall landings, fishers slip unwanted catches. Compared to typical discarding, slipping leads to a lower fishing mortality rate as part of the catch is released alive. With the reduction of sardine quota, daily limits and long periods of sardine capture ban, the frequency and volume of sardine likely slipped will increase as the fleet directs the fishing effort to other pelagic species that are found typically mixed with sardine. Slipping is considered to be variable throughout the country and the year. Using onboard observed data in Portugal, we intend to describe and assess its occurrence at the fleet level, considering its variability. We present slipping patterns of sardine and chub mackerel in the Portuguese purse-seine fleet. We argue for the need of practices minimizing the need for slipping, such as sharing catch between vessels and improving identification of shoals.},

Historically, sardine has been the target species of the fishery and traditionally perceived as the most important species in the fleet. With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its incomes by targeting chub-mackerel in the Center and South and anchovy in the North. The present work aims to analyse changes in fleet behavior concerning the reduction of annual quotas and the establishment of daily quotas for sardines in the period 2005-2020, to assess their impact on annual landing dynamics and improve the assessment of pelagic species. Behavior changes have been observed in the fleet along the country, such as searching for new fishing grounds and species with more market value such as anchovy. Especially, fisheries data may be an important supplement to information obtained from traditional surveys, that cover a part of the history. Having the full picture is important to get a better assessment of pelagic species and further discussion and/or sharing with stakeholders (e. g. fishers and fisher associations, fisheries researchers, the industry, NGO{\textasciiacute}s and general public).},

  abstract = {In Portugal mainland, the purse seine fishery is one of the most important fisheries, accounting for about 50\% by weight of landings. At present, these fleets mainly target sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and chub mackerel (Scomber colias). This work aimed to study the Portuguese purse seine fleet activity (vessel length{$>$}16m) and catch composition using onboard observations from 2009 to 2013. Data were collected during 179 trips and 229 fishing sets. Short trips (mean 9.38 h) with one to two sets (duration time 1.39 h/set) were observed, where most of the trip was dedicated to searching (43.7\% of total trip duration) and fishing (23.5\%). Fishing time depended of the number of sets and search time, which increased due to the growing scarcity of fish and distance to and from fishing grounds to the homeport. S. colias was the main species captured followed by S. pilchardus, although there were an inverse trend in the two species landings. Other pelagic species such as horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), Atlantic mackerel (S. scombrus), blue jack mackerel (T. picturatus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were also caught but represented small volumes of the catch. The average capture and landings observed were 4.47 ({\textpm}S.D. 7.64) and 3.19 ({\textpm}S.D. 4.46) tons per set. Capture and landings were both higher in the North, intermediate in the South and lower in the Centre. Differences between fish captured and fish landed are due to slipping. Slipping was more frequent in the North, mainly because of the implementation of daily limit quotas. In the South, usually was the result of the mixture of S. pilchardus with non-commercial species that would decrease its landing price. Throughout the study period, S. pilchardus landings peaked of 64 000 ton in 2008, decreased 20\% until 2011 and dropped sharply after 2012. Landing patterns of S. colias, the second most important species, have been inverse, increasing continuously since 2009. On the overall, the decline of S. pilchardus landings has been compensated by increasing capture and landings of S. colias along the country.},

Sampling is made onboard of cooperative vessels, in Crustacean and Fish fleet segments of the Portuguese mainland bottom trawl fleet. Data presented in this work refers to 2004-2005 period, where 471 hauls and 95 trips were sampled in 25 different vessels. Composition by species of landings and discards is presented and compared between fleet segments and along Portuguese coast, through percentages of landings, discards and occurrence in weigth and in number. Species were separated in three groups: (i) commercial species that are never discarded (ii) commercial species that sometimes are discarded and (iii) species that are allways discarded. Total number of different species caught in Crustacean fleet was 168 in 2004 and 140 in 2005. In Fish fleet, 165 different species were cauht in 2004 and 157 in 2005. Once fishing practices differ between fleets, with distinct targeted species and consequently also distinct bycatch and discarded species, differencies in catch composition was obtained.},

A generalized linear model (GLM) and graphical analysis were performed to evaluate how discards are related to factors and variables such as year, fleet, fishing area, fishing depth, fishing time, and number of days of trip. Neither fishing area nor fishing depth interferes with discards in weight. However a relation between discards and number of days of trip was observed. Consequently also fishing time is related with discards. Total discards estimation was calculated using fishing time as auxiliary variable. The use of fishing time in this procedure resulted in lower discards estimates and CV's when compared to the one obtained using trips as auxiliary variable. The same method was used to get length composition of hake discards. Big differences in length composition were also obtained when comparing both methods.},

  abstract = {Improving our ability to predict recruitment is a key element in fisheries management. However, the interactions between population dynamics and different environmental factors are complex and often non-linear, making it difficult to produce robust predictions. `Machine-learning' techniques (in particular, supervised classification methods) have been proposed as useful tools, to overcome such difficulties. In this study, a methodology is proposed to build a robust classifier for fish recruitment prediction with sparse and noisy data. The methodology consists of 4 steps: (1) a semi-automated recruitment discretization method; (2) supervised discretization of predictors; (3) multivariate and non-redundant predictors selection; (4) learning a probabilistic classifier. In terms of fisheries management, the classifier estimated performance has important consequences and, to be useful, the manager needs to know the risk that is being taken when using this number. Probabilistic classifiers such as `naive Bayes', have the advantage that, in addition to the predictions, estimate also the probability of each possible outcome. Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and hake (Merluccius merluccius) recruitments are used as application examples. `Two-intervals' recruitment discretization accomplishes 70\% accuracies and Brier scores of around 0.10, for both anchovy and hake recruitment. In comparison, `three-intervals' recruitment discretization accomplishes 50\% accuracies; and Brier scores of around 0.25 for anchovy and 0.30 for hake recruitment. These statistics are the result of validating not only the classifier, but also the previous steps, as a whole methodology.},

  abstract = {Onboard observer programs are key to collect data for fishery dynamics analysis and species bycatch and discard estimation. Major sources of bias of onboard sampling for catch data collection concern the vessel selection method, representativeness of catch sampling data and changes in fishing behavior in the presence of observers. This study was motivated by the worldwide issue of low number of vessels included in the sampling frame due to several types of refusals, and the representativeness of the samples for obtaining accurate catch estimates. An\- alyses were performed using trips from a bottom otter trawl (target fleet) and from the sampling frame, with and without observers onboard. Multivariate analysis of trips was conducted using logbook data, including landings, trip duration, fishing hours and spatial information, but not discards. Two groups of fishing trips were identified within the target fleet during the study period (2012- 2015) with distinct fishing regimes, total landings and main landed species. Vessels from the sampling frame were representative of the target fleet and no observer effects occurred in the sampled trips. These findings support the assertion that the sampling frame used is an indicator fleet and analogous to a reference fleet. Cluster-based discard approaches improved the discard esti\- mates precision, when compared to the fleet-based, in particular the cluster stratified approach. Our study suggests that the implementation of a threshold on the species prevalence in discards may potentially introduce bias in the estimates. Discard estimation without applying a threshold, with fleet- or cluster-based approach, should be ultimately dictated by end-users need, based on the trade-off between bias and variance.},

  abstract = {Fisheries management requires the best scientific knowledge on the exploitation and conservation status of stocks. This is challenging for by-catch species, for which necessary data for their assessment is more limited than for target ones. That is the case for the thornback ray, Raja clavata, in the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean), whose exploitation and conservation status are addressed here for the first time, in an integrative approach, by using innovative assessment methods and genetic diversity analysis. The time series of fishing landings from 1964 and MEDITS trawl survey data from 2004 were used to apply CMSY++ and Bayesian state-space Schaefer production models. We also estimated the genetic diversity of the Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene from 31 individuals collected during MEDITS surveys. The species showed overexploitation with a current fishing mortality (F) below that producing maximum sustainable yield (FMSY), but with a current stock biomass (B) lower than BMSY. Despite the fact that the exploitation status is stable or even has improved in the last decades, the overexploitation period since the late 1970s seems to have reduced levels of genetic diversity, below those of related species and other populations of R. clavata. This low genetic diversity may entail the loss of adaptive potential, making the species more vulnerable to fishing and the current climate change.},

  abstract = {The study of geometric morphometrics among stocks has proven to be a valuable tool in delineating fish spatial distributions and discriminating distinct population units. Variations in fish body morphology can be linked to genetic factors or to phenotypic adaptability in response to environmental variables. The tub gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucerna) is a demersal species that usually lives in the bottom of the continental shelf, being widely distributed along the northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black seas. Worldwide interest in the species has increased since 2006, when ICES recognized its potential for commercial exploitation. However, despite its broad geographic occurrence, to date, research on C. lucerna population structure at large spatial scales is still lacking. In this paper, body geometric morphometrics, using a landmark-based truss network, was applied in order to discriminate C. lucerna populations caught in three different fishery grounds areas along the northeast Atlantic: Conwy Bay (United Kingdom), Biscay Bay (Spain) and Matosinhos (Portugal). The results obtained in this study revealed a high overall relocation success (95\%) of samples to their original locations, thus demonstrating the existence of significant regional differences and indicating that we are dealing with different fish population units. Moreover, the data revealed a partial overlap between individuals from Spain and United Kingdom, suggesting that in geographically distant areas these populations may inhabit similar environments. However, to corroborate these findings, future works using a holistic approach with alternative and complimentary stock assessment tools (e.g., genetic and phenotypic natural tags) are highly recommended.},

However, to date, little is known about its habitat residency and whether the species can be considered a marine estuarine-dependent fish. Otolith microchemistry has proven effective in providing information about fish movement patterns throughout different water salinities. In this study, core-to-edge transects of Sr:Ca in the fish saccular otoliths of 35 juveniles of C. lucerna captured in March 2007 by a scientific survey along the Portuguese coast were used to assess the species movement between brackish and marine waters. Data suggest that most individuals (97\%) have an estuarine-dependent profile, with 63\% showing a clear presence in marine waters during the early life history periods. Evidence of an estuarine residence throughout the fish life cycle was found in only 3\% of individuals. Ba:Ca profiles did not reflect an inverse relationship with Sr:Ca salinity results but corroborated findings from other authors about the influence of upwelling processes and freshwater runoffs on Ba incorporation into the otoliths of coastal fish. Furthermore, the data also showed that C. lucerna can occupy and migrate among habitats with diverse salinity degrees, showing high environmental plasticity and adaptation.},

A preliminary review of global data indicates that individuals of 25 cetacean species (two mysticete, 23 odontocete) have been documented to have died in working trawls or discarded trawling gear. Cetacean interactions with trawls are complex, in part because both fishermen and cetaceans are drawn to areas of high prey density. Furthermore, within such areas, cetaceans are probably often attracted to trawling activities because they make it easier for the animals to exploit a concentrated food source. Individuals of 15 (possibly 16) cetacean species (13 odontocete, and one or even two mysticete) have been reported to feed in association with trawls. Animals follow working nets (feeding on stirred-up organisms or fish gilled in mesh) and also feed on discarded by-catch. Damage to gear as a result of feeding interactions or entanglement has been reported. Such damage results in (1) harm to the animals, (2) creation of negative opinions of cetaceans by fishermen (regardless of whether a cetacean or a shark is, in fact, responsible for the damage in question), and (3) loss of time and money for repair and replacement of gear. The relationships of cetaceans with trawls need to be further studied to determine what effects the trawl fisheries have on the ecology and population status of the whales and dolphins involved.},

The evolution of maturity of both sexes throughout the year was studied based on the macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the gonads. Specimens with the largest total length were found in Funchal, whereas the smallest size was recorded in the NW of Scotland. Neither spawners nor post-spawners were ever observed in NW of Scotland and Sesimbra. In Sesimbra, only a few individuals attained pre-spawning stage and most of the early developing females exhibited atresia in their ovaries. In Funchal, all the maturity stages were found; spawners occurred from September to December (females) and from August to December (males). Length of first maturity for females was estimated to be around 1000 mm. Two groups of spawners with different sizes were observed during the spawning period off Madeira.},

  abstract = {In wild Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus, the lipid content of the lateral muscle varies according to the season from around 30\% in autumn to less than 5\% in spring. To be able to offer mackerel with optimal quality on the market during spring or early summer after overwintering, it is necessary that the muscle lipid content is close to 30\%, which is favoured by the customers. Wild caught mackerel were kept in salmon cages fed a high energy (300 g fat kg--1) salmon diet rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from October 1997 to April 1998. Fish were submerged at 20--40 m at a temperature above 5 {$^\circ$}C from January until April. Then the fish were brought to the surface and randomly divided into three duplicate groups, i.e., non-fed, 150 g fat kg--1, and 300 g fat kg--1 and kept until August 1998. The mortality was very low and the body weight doubled concomitant with an increased muscle lipid content from 19.5\% to 30.9\% during the first six months. Both groups receiving feed further increased the body weight and muscle lipid content at the same magnitude towards the end of the experiment. During the first six months the cross sectional area (CSA) of red muscle fibres increased 3.3fold and this size was maintained throughout the experiment. In contrast, in non-fed mackerel the increase in CSA of red muscle fibres was 1.5fold. White muscle fibres revealed a much weaker response in fed mackerel and were not affected in mackerel deprived of feed. In wild mackerel the fatty acid oxidation ({$\beta$}-oxidation) capacity dominated in the red part of the lateral muscle. During the winter an increased {$\beta$}-oxidation capacity was found in heart and liver, whereas both red and white part of the lateral muscle showed a low fatty acid catabolism. In contrast, during summer red and white part of the lateral muscle possessed high {$\beta$}-oxidation capacities, particularly in high energy-fed and non-fed mackerel. It is concluded that it is possible to feed captive mackerel during the winter and produce mackerel with a high quality for the market in early spring.},

  abstract = {"This atlas stems from an experience on fish maturity staging carried out at the Mediterranean level. It aims to present sound approaches to maturity sampling for a wide range of Mediterranean species, based on an accurate and precise determination of the different maturity stages. It includes macroscopic photos of gonads belonging to the main species, and for some of them, a validation-based histological analysis is also presented. The main categories investigated in the atlas are bony fihs, cartilaginous fish, both oviparous and viviparous, crustaceans and cephalopods. Maturity is one of the most relevant biological parameters used in stock assessment programmes. Indeed, the macroscopic stage of gonadal development is an essential feature in estimating the maturity ogive and spawning stock biomass. It is also useful for determining the spawning season of a species and for monitoring long-term changes in the spawning cycle, as well as for many other research needs related to the biology of fish. In current data collection programmes carried out in the Mediterranean which cover extensive samplings of maturity stages, some specific technical aspects have not always been taken into consideration, and collected data cannot reach the required precision levels. Also, the coding schemes in use and the uncertainty in the interpretation of particular stages can give rise to misinterpretations of the actual maturity stage leading to inaccurate spawning stock biomass estimations. Several stock assessments are therefore based on time-invariant maturity ogives and only partially cover the spatial distribution of the stocks. Hence, on several occasions, the need has been expressed to improve the identification of the macroscopic maturity stages through a standardization of operational procedures and terminology. Hence, one of the solutions for overcoming these problems was to develop an atlas of the macroscopic and histological maturity stages of the main species of commercial interest in the Mediterranean"--Back cover},

  abstract = {Fleet dynamics was addressed for three cephalopod taxa of commercial interest, the squid Loligo vulgaris, the octopuses Octopus vulgaris and Eledone cirrhosa, and the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, for 48 trawlers of the fish trawling fleet. Landing profiles (LP) were identified based on the species composition of the landings using hierarchical cluster analysis. Four out of a total of 12 different LP were related to cephalopods and other species associated with them. The effects on the landing proportions of a number of variables, year, season and vessel, are analysed for each of the species studied using generalized linear models (GLM). The factor ``vessel'', including an ensemble of technical characteristics as well as the abilities of individual skippers, explained most of the model deviance, strongly reinforcing the existence of a fleet component dedicated to catch cephalopods. However, time also explains much of the variation found in the data. Seasonal alternation between landings of octopodidae and cuttlefish was observed within a small group of old trawlers operating mainly off the south coast, following the abundance cycles of these species. For a larger group of more modern trawlers, operating off the western coast, inter-annual shift between octopus and squid was found, together with a well marked seasonal pattern between the catches of cephalopods and horse mackerel. Spatial patterns of activity were identified using vessel monitoring system (VMS) data available for trawlers in Portugal, demonstrating the existence of cephalopod targeting strategies in Portuguese fish trawling activities.},

  abstract = {Each year almost a million fish are aged from otoliths, primarily to estimate proportions at age for use in stock assessments. The preparation and reading of otoliths is time-consuming and thus expensive. Two techniques have been proposed to reduce costs. The first is length-mediated estimation, in which the length distribution from a large sample of fish is converted to an age distribution, using information (usually in the form of an age--length key) from a smaller sample containing length and age data. The second is to infer age from otolith weight (and/or other otolith measurements). These two cost-saving ideas are combined in a new method, length-mediated mixture analysis. It requires three samples -- one with lengths only, one with lengths and otolith measurements, and one with lengths, otolith measurements and ages -- and estimation is by maximum likelihood. The use of this method, which can be thought of as a generalisation of three established methods of age inference, is illustrated in two simulation experiments in a cost-benefit framework.},

Three conceptual models of network structure, random, small-world, and scale-free, each have different implications for system behavior and tolerance to perturbations. We constructed two food web network models using detailed quantitative information on the stomach contents of 57 predator (fish) species collected during trawl surveys of the Gulf of Alaska between 1981 and 2002. The resulting food webs displayed both small-world and scale-free network properties, suggesting that impacts on one species might spread to many through short interaction chains and that while most food web connections are not critical, a small set of fished species support critical structural connections. Ecosystem-based fishery management should therefore first focus on protecting the highly connected species in the network to avoid structural impacts of fishing on the food web.

  abstract = {For each Portuguese fleet component, landings of biogeographic groups of fish species were compared for the period of 1993--2009. Wide-distribution species were the most abundant in landings, but have shown a decreasing trend. Temperate species had higher landings in trawl fisheries, whereas subtropical species were most abundant and exhibiting an increasing trend in landings of multi-gear fisheries. A latitudinal gradient was observed, with landings of temperate species being more important in the North-western coast than in the South-western and South coasts. Although trawl fisheries were relatively more important in the North-western coast, there has been a recent increase in the relative importance of multi-gear fisheries and of subtropical species in this area. The increasing relative importance of subtropical species in Portuguese fisheries along with the fact that landings of subtropical species were higher in multi-gear fisheries could indicate an easier adaptation of Portuguese multigear fisheries to the effects of climate change. However, as multi-gear fisheries include a wide range of gears, techniques and target-species, they may not all respond in the same manner to changes in fish species' distribution. Among multi-gear fisheries, trammel nets catch a wider variety of species and a wider size range than gill nets or longlines; thus, trammel net fishers can adapt to changes in abundance of the main target species more readily than those using more species- and size-specific gears. Therefore, trammel net fisheries could more easily adapt to the effects of climate change on fish distribution than gill net or longline fisheries.},

  abstract = {We investigated and compared the pattern of accumulation of recent and late atretic follicles in the ovaries of Iberian sardine, Sardina pilchardus, in relation to body size with the aim to examine whether late atresia can be used in back-calculations of individual spawning history. Oppositely to earlier stages, late atresia in sardine was shown to accumulate even at peak spawning periods in fish of larger size/age indicating a relationship between atretic intensity and the distant reproductive performance of the individuals. Despite the fact that intensity of late atresia was very high in some occasions, its accumulation was not shown to impede imminent spawning activity. Lack of dependence between imminent spawning activity and the intensity of late atresia was related to the differential pattern with which postovulatory and atretic follicles are associated to the lamellar epithelium of the ovary. Finally, the effect of the `reference trap' which is a major source of bias when quantifying structures in stereological measurements, could be mediated or even completely removed by using a measure of ovarian growth, such as gonosomatic index in the present study, as a covariate when modeling variability in the intensity of atresia.},

Annual distributions were generated for mature animals and juveniles for spring/summer (the peak spawning season) and autumn (peak recruitment) using an inverse distance weighted deterministic interpolation. Based on the persistence of abundant recruits and mature animals, respectively, nursery and spawning grounds were identified. The correlation between annual recruitment and SST during hatching and recruitment was also investigated. Concentrations of juveniles (nurseries) were located off the southwest coast of Sicily and in the central Strait of Sicily, including south of Lampedusa on the African shelf, but just one consistent concentration of mature animals (spawning grounds) was found in the northwestern part of the Strait. There was a significant positive correlation between recruitment and SST. Results are discussed in the light of environmental parameters, and a hypothesis on possible stock units in the area was developed. The direct and indirect effects of SST variation on the recruitment process were also examined.},

  abstract = {Cephalopods, including octopuses, squids, and cuttlefishes, are exploited by both bottom trawl and small-scale fisheries (SSF) in most of the Mediterranean areas. Bottom trawl fisheries regard cephalopods as a valuable bycatch, whereas for SSF, they are among the main target species. Cephalopods account for a relatively small proportion of the total landings in the Mediterranean. However, from an economic point of view, four cephalopods, Eledone cirrhosa, Eledone moschata, Octopus vulgaris, and Sepia officinalis, account for approximately 15\% of the total landing value. Despite their economic importance, there are very few stock assessments of cephalopods in the Mediterranean because it is difficult to assess them by classical age-based methods, given their short life-cycles, and highly variable growth and recruitment. The production of E. cirrhosa, E. moschata, Illex coindettii, Loligo vulgaris, O. vulgaris, S. officinalis, and Todaropsis eblanae in the waters off the south of Sicily accounts for approximately 8\% of the total Mediterranean yield of cephalopods. This study presents the first attempt to assess the state of these cephalopods in the Strait of Sicily by using surplus production models. Since species-wise landing statistics may be unreliable because of their morphological similarity, some octopuses (E. cirrhosa and E. moschata) and ommastrephid squids (I. coindetii and T. eblanae) were assessed combined. Landing data and abundance indices from trawl surveys were used to describe cephalopod stock dynamics through the Bayesian State Space Schaefer model (BSM) and Surplus Production model in Continuous Time (SPiCT) models. As survey data were not considered reliable indicators of their abundance, O. vulgaris, S. officinalis, and L. vulgaris stocks were assessed using the Catch-Maximum Sustainable Yield (CMSY) model. Overall, squid and cuttlefish stocks were observed to be in healthy conditions. However, assessments of octopus stocks indicated that their condition was critical or recovering. Here, we discuss the different stock statuses in the light of evolving fisheries and environmental factors in the area over time. Although cephalopods are not a priority in the current management system of Mediterranean fisheries, the importance of these species in the food web and their relevance for SSF underline their importance and their exploitation status should be periodically evaluated.},

Early summer acoustic data of sardine juveniles were modelled using generalized additive models along with satellite environmental and bathymetry data. Selected models were used to construct maps that exhibit the probability of presence in the study areas, as well as throughout the entire Mediterranean basin, as a measure of habitat adequacy. Areas with high probability of supporting sardine juvenile presence persistently within the study period were identified throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, within the study period, a positive relationship was found between suitable habitat extent and the changes in abundance of sardine juveniles in each study area.},

  abstract = {Overexploitation of bycatch and target species in marine capture fisheries is the most widespread and direct driver of change and loss of global marine biodiversity. Bycatch in purse seine and pelagic longline tuna fisheries, the two primary gear types for catching tunas, is a primary mortality source of some populations of seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and sharks. Bycatch of juvenile tunas and unmarketable species and sizes of other fish in purse seine fisheries, and juvenile swordfish in longline fisheries, contributes to the overexploitation of some stocks, and is an allocation issue. There has been substantial progress in identifying gear technology solutions to seabird and sea turtle bycatch on longlines and to direct dolphin mortality in purse seines. Given sufficient investment, gear technology solutions are probably feasible for the remaining bycatch problems. More comprehensive consideration across species groups is needed to identify conflicts as well as mutual benefits from mitigation methods. Fishery-specific bycatch assessments are necessary to determine the efficacy, economic viability, practicality and safety of alternative mitigation methods. While support for gear technology research and development has generally been strong, political will to achieve broad uptake of best practices has been lacking. The five Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have achieved mixed progress mitigating bycatch. Large gaps remain in both knowledge of ecological risks and governance of bycatch. Most binding conservation and management measures fall short of gear technology best practice. A lack of performance standards, in combination with an inadequate observer coverage for all but large Pacific purse seiners, and incomplete data collection, hinders assessing measures' efficacy. Compliance is probably low due to inadequate surveillance and enforcement. Illegal, unreported and unregulated tuna fishing hampers governance efforts. Replacing consensus-based decision-making and eliminating opt-out provisions would help. Instituting rights-based management measures could elicit improved bycatch mitigation practices. While gradual improvements in an international governance of bycatch can be expected, market-based mechanisms, including retailers and their suppliers working with fisheries to gradually improve practices and governance, promise to be expeditious and effective. \& 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the 1970s mathematical ecology emerged as a significant force in the fields of fisheries, forestry, pest control and disease. But at that time there was little if any connection between the models used and data. It was not until the 1990s that there was a melding of statistical tools and the models used in these fields. With the declaration of the 200 mile exclusive economic zones in the late 1970s scientists in fisheries needed to provide management advice, and were generally at the forefront of using statistical tools to estimate the parameters of their models. During the 1990s advances in computation enabled Bayesian statistics to emerge as a major force in such analysis.},

To elucidate these processes we use metabolic, neutral and descriptive statistical models to analyse how richness responds to maximum species length, fish abundance, temperature, primary production, depth, latitude and longitude, while accounting for differences in species catchability, sampling effort and mesh size. Data: Results from 53,382 bottom trawl hauls representing 50 fish assemblages. Location: The northern Atlantic from Nova Scotia to Guinea. Time period: 1977--2013. Methods: A descriptive generalized additive model was used to identify functional relationships between species richness and potential drivers, after which nonlinear estimation techniques were used to parameterize: (a) a `best' fitting model of species richness built on the functional relationships, (b) an environmental model based on latitude, longitude and depth, and mechanistic models based on (c) metabolic and (d) neutral theory.},

  abstract = {Macroscopically it is not possible to distinguish immature from resting females, for several species. European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is included in this case. Misclassification of resting females, that have already contributed to the removal of the stock in a given year, as immature, will lead to an SSB underestimation of that year. The use of GSI and HIS to differentiate these two stages was investigated but does not give an accurate answer. Only histology can allow the correct classification of resting females. Taking to account that the proportion of resting females is lower during the peak of the spawning season than the rest of the year, maturity ogives should only be based on data collected during the peak of the spawning season. It is recommended to collect for both sexes immature/resting gonads for histology purposes in a length class basis to estimate a correction factor that could be applicable to the macroscopic data. A standard macroscopic maturity stage key was proposed, based on an agreed macroscopic gonads photos interpretation. This standard stage key is in accordance with the histological knowledge of this species.},

  abstract = {Fisheries bycatches and discards constitute a significant problem in many fisheries worldwide. Unlike the pelagic purse-seine, the demersal purse seine usually targets high commercial value demersal species such as sea breams (e.g., Diplodus spp., Pagellus spp., Sparus aurata) and the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), while discards consist mainly of pelagic species and juveniles of the above mentioned species. In order to evaluate the efficiency of a selectivity device in reducing bycatch and consequently of discards in a demersal purse seine fishery, experimental deployments were carried out. The bycatch reducing device (BRD) consisted in the use of a panel of diamond-shaped mesh netting of 70 mm stretched mesh in the posterior part of the purse seine. Data from 61 experimental fishing trials allowed the evaluation of discards, with Scomber japonicus, Boops boops, Sardina pilchardus, Diplodus bellottii and Belone belone being the main discarded species. The mean discard ratio per set was 0.49 ({\textpm} 0.30 standard deviation). The causes for discarding were also identified, with low commercial value being the most important reason. The results of the trials with BRD, were promising, with an average of 49\% ({\textpm} 24\%) of the fish escaping per set, especially from those species that are most discarded. Overall, the use of this method for reducing discards can be considered positive for the following reasons: there is no need for structural modification of the fishing gear, the BRD is easy to deploy, and it is efficient in terms of species, sizes and quantities of fish that manage to escape. It therefore has significant benefits for the demersal purse seine fishery and possibly for other ``m{\'e}tiers'' as well.},

  abstract = {The common octopus Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797 is the most fished cephalopod species along the Spanish coasts. Its catches fluctuate greatly due to the short life cycle of the species and to the annual variability of the recruitment pattern, strongly dependent on the environmental conditions affecting the eggs and paralarvae. This study examines the common octopus fishery, the catch composition, and the main features of the reproductive biology of this species in the Gulf of Alicante (Spanish Eastern coast, Western Mediterranean FAO division 37.1.1). The common octopus fishery was studied analysing the monthly landing and effort data by fishing gear from 1994 to 2005. Monthly samplings of the commercial O. vulgaris landings from trawlers and clay pots from January 2004 to December 2005 resulted in the measuring of 1833 specimens to enable analysis of the catch composition, and allowed the biological sampling of 1176 individuals to provide the reproductive parameters of the species in the study area. The length-weight relationship calculated for the species was BW = 0.51 * DML 2.87. The yearly sex ratios (males: females) were 1:1 (trawl, 2004), 1:0.74 (trawl, 2005), and 1:0.88 (clay pots, 2005). The size (dorsal mantle length, DML) at maturity of the species in the study area was 9.67 cm for males and 14.38 cm for females. The gonadosomatic index reached a peak between April and July for males and in July for females. The Fulton condition index was lower in both sexes between June and September, and for males in November-December, whereas for both sexes the values of the digestive gland index were at their maximum between June and December. The energy allocation between somatic and reproductive growth was investigated and the results suggested that the energy spent on reproduction mainly came from feeding, and not from energy stored in the mantle tissues or in the digestive gland.},

Individual Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) were gathered for each vessel to perform, thereafter, the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). DEA matrices were generated based on the LCI in order to obtain the efficiency values for each unit. Finally, based on the efficiency projections provided by the DEA model, a new LCIA was performed for inefficient vessels in order to calculate the potential environmental benefits of operating at higher levels of efficiency. Results and discussion The average efficiency of the fleet in the two different years of assessment was slightly above 60 \%. Moreover, individual vessels showed a fairly low standard deviation across the 2 years of assessment, demonstrating that units with higher levels of efficiency tend to maintain these values through the analysed window. In fact, this result, given its strong correlation with fuel use, appears to have relation with the existence of a certain level of Bskipper effect{\textasciicircum}. Important environmental benefits, mainly linked to the optimisation of fuel resources, could be attained if inefficient vessels were to operate efficiently, especially in terms of two main impact categories: climate change and fossil depletion. Conclusions The results in this study confirm that fishing small-pelagic fish shows low energy intensity as compared to other fisheries. However, despite this worldwide tendency, the use of LCA+DEA confirms that substantial improvements in terms of optimising energy and material inputs, as well as in reducing environmental impacts, can be attained in these fishing fleets.},

Geostatistics provides descriptive tools such as semivariograms to characterize the spatial pattern of continuous and categorical soil attributes. Various interpolation {\v Z}kriging. techniques capitalize on the spatial correlation between observations to predict attribute values at unsampled locations using information related to one or several attributes. An important contribution of geostatistics is the assessment of the uncertainty about unsampled values, which usually takes the form of a map of the probability of exceeding critical values, such as regulatory thresholds in soil pollution or criteria for soil quality. This uncertainty assessment can be combined with expert knowledge for decision making such as delineation of contaminated areas where remedial measures should be taken or areas of good soil quality where specific management plans can be developed. Last, stochastic simulation allows one to generate several models {\v Z}images. of the spatial distribution of soil attribute values, all of which are consistent with the information available. A given scenario {\v Z}remediation process, land use policy. can be applied to the set of realizations, allowing the uncertainty of the response {\v Z}remediation efficiency, soil productivity. to be assessed. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

This problem has been discussed based on three main criteria: (a) oocyte size frequency distribution, (b) the number of yolked oocytes in the ovary and (c) atresia. The analysis of the oocyte size frequency distribution showed that no distinct hiatus could be observed between pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes. The number of yolked oocytes in the ovary was found higher in imminent spawning ovaries than in the pre-spawing, while a greater number of late yolked oocytes was found in recently spawning ovaries than in the pre-spawning. High incidence of atresia was also found in recently spawning (6--22\%) and spent ovaries (over 29\%). Those findings indicate that horse mackerel has most probably an indeterminate fecundity.},

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List is considered the global standard for evaluating extinction risks. IUCN criteria also inform national extinction risk assessments. Bayesian models, including the state-of-the-art JARA (`Just Another Red List Assessment') tool, deliver probabilistic statements about species falling into extinction risk categories, thereby enabling characterisation and communication of uncertainty in extinction risk assessments.                                                     We coupled the state-of-the-art VAST (`Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal') modelling tool and JARA, for better informed Red List assessments of marine fishes. In this framework, VAST is fitted to scientific survey catch rate data to provide indices to JARA whose uncertainty is propagated to JARA outcomes suggesting extinction risk categories (under the population reduction criterion). In addition, VAST delivers a valuable habitat assessment to better understand what may be driving extinction risk in the study region. Here, we demonstrate the coupled VAST-JARA modelling framework by applying it to five contrasting North Sea species, with or without a quantitative stock assessment and with different conservation statuses according to the latest global Red List assessments.                                                     The North Sea application coupled with previous assessments and studies suggest that, among the three elasmobranchs, starry ray is in most need of urgent research (and conservation actions where appropriate), followed by spurdog, while lesser-spotted dogfish is increasing in biomass. Moreover, both the VAST-JARA modelling framework and previous research indicate that, while European plaice is not of conservation concern, cod has likely met the IUCN criteria for being listed as Endangered recently.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     . The predictions of the VAST-JARA modelling framework for North Sea species, including JARA output and VAST habitat assessment, constitute valuable supporting information to make interpretations based on Red List guidelines, which will help decision-makers in their next North Sea Red List assessment. We foresee applications of the modelling framework to assist Red List assessments of numerous marine fishes worldwide. Our modelling framework has many potential advantageous uses, including informing resource management about climate change impacts on species' extinction risks.},

This fish product presents high nutritional value, being its lipidic content associated with important health benefits. Consequently, it can be advantageously used to produce therapeutically active de\- livery devices. Roe lipids were extracted using the Matyash method. After lipid film hydration and extrusion, sardine roe-derived large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs), designated as fishroesomes, presented a size of {$\approx$}330 nm and a significant negative surface charge ({$\approx-$} 27 mV). Radical scavenging assays demonstrated that fishroesomes efficiently neutralized peroxyl, hydroxyl and nitric oxide radicals. Moreover, fishroesomes significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by LPS-stimulated macrophages at non-toxic concentrations for L929 and THP-1 cells. Consequently, the developed liposomes exhibit unique properties as bioactive drug carriers for inflammatory diseases treatment.},

From juvenile landings collected over 38{$\quad$}years, the thresholds of environmental factors were determined that limited the optimal environmental window (OEW) for sardine (               Sardina pilchardus               recruitment success in the northwestern Iberian peninsula. The environmental factors considered were: water column stability in February, offshore water transport in March--April (               Q                                x                              MA), upwelling intensity in the preceding year from May to August (               Q                                x                              MJJA), and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. From 1875 to the mid-1920s, the mean number of years within the OEW was relatively constant. However, since the mid-1920s, there have been oscillations and alternating decades with high and low number of years within the OEW, which were related to oscillations in sardine landings. From 1906 to 2000, there were four record, low sardine catches in the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, related to a high number of successive years with prevailing conditions out of the OEW. From 1875 to the present, a high year-to-year variation of the NAO,               Q                                x                              MJJA and water stability in February was observed, although with mean values usually within the OEW. The collapse in the 1950s was related, partly, to successive years with low               Q                                x                              MJJA. Successive years with high NAO values may be related to the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1990s.               Q                                x                              MA has been the most significant factor controlling SRS in this area, being the factor related to the low catches observed in the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. Water stability was not responsible for any of the collapses observed, but since the 1920s, there has been a significant trend toward decreasing water column stability before the onset of the spring bloom.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine how climatic (North Atlantic Oscillation winter index, NAO, December through March), oceanographic (upwelling intensity, turbulence, water column stability and larval offshore transport) and biotic (adult abundance) factors affect recruitment success of Sardina pilchardus off the northwest coast of the Iberian peninsula. Annual sardine juvenile landings in the port of Vigo (Spain) from 1980 to 2000 were used as an indicator of sardine recruitment success. Ekman transport along the x-axis (Qx) in February (QxF), from March to April (QxMA), from May to August over the preceding year (QxMJJA), and NAO explained 86\% of the variance observed in catches of sardine juveniles. Due to the north-south orientation of the west coast of the Iberian peninsula, upwelling intensity and larval drift offshore are higher the lower the Qx. Landings of sardine juveniles were higher in those years with moderate QxF, high QxMA, low QxMJJA and low NAO values. There was a dome-shaped relationship between sardine juvenile landings and QxF. Under both high and low Qx conditions, the upper layer is strongly mixed. Therefore, the reduced recruitment success observed at both high and low QxF values could be due to a stratified upper layer in February enhancing primary production during the spring bloom and, hence, larval food availability. As March and April are the main spawning periods for sardine in this area, the reduced sardine recruitment success observed as QxMA decreased was probably due to the transport offshore of eggs and larvae. In this area the main upwelling season is from May to August. Therefore, the positive relationship between upwelling intensity from May to August and nutrient concentration in surface layers could explain why landings of sardine were higher when QxMJJA over the preceding year was lower. Finally, in years with low NAO sardine recruitment success was higher. When NAO is lower than average, the winter/spring temperatures are warmer and transport offshore is lower.},

When the solar cycle is short, there is a trend towards increasing water transport onshore, which favours larval retention in areas close to the coast and, hence, sardine catches increase. However, when the solar cycle is longer, the trend is toward increasing water transport offshore, carrying eggs and larvae into areas where there is not enough food to survive and, therefore, decreasing sardine catches. These findings reveal the potential importance of solar activity on all biological process affected by coastal upwelling, including pelagic fisheries.},

However, it is quite difficult to estimate given its correlation with other parameters, variation in processes governing population dynamics and data acquisition, as well as other factors such as ageing error. Meta-analytical approaches relating M to other life history parameters are often used to provide an estimate and/or Bayesian prior for M. Longevity is the one of these life history parameters most directly related to M. The maximum observed or estimated age serves as a proxy for longevity in predicting, or developing a prior for, M to be used within a stock assessment or other population model. Consideration of the age data and factors that might influence its quality for deter\- mining a maximum age is important in using a meta-analytically derived relationship between maximum age and M, though these factors are not completely absent from the data used to develop that relationship. Here, we discuss these issues, propose a relationship between maximum age and M, and develop an updated prior for M based upon maximum age.},

It is examined whether variations in catches of cod, herring, mackerel, anchovy and sardines in the ICES statistical areas are related to variations in ocean temperature. Temperatures at certain locations along the Norwegian coast are taken as proxies for temperatures in the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea. It is found that the catches of cod in the North Sea are inversely correlated with temperature and that recruitment and catches of cod in the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea are positively related to temperature. There is also some indication of a positive correlation between temperature and the catches of mackerel in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, and between temperature and the catches of sardines in the North Sea.},

In one model, for the Georges Bank Closed Areas, natural mortality was estimated by year for all sizes, whereas in the other two models (for the Georges Bank Open Areas and the Mid-Atlantic Bight), annual variation in natural mortality was estimated for juveniles only. Estimating natural mortality by year improved the performance over fixed natural mortality in all three models, as measured by Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and reduced retrospective patterns. There was evidence that natural mortality is density-dependent. Large recruitment events were asso\- ciated with substantial increases in juvenile natural mortality, and natural mortality in the Georges Bank Closed Areas tended to increase at high biomass. Estimation of natural mortality was facilitated by survey data that gave estimates of absolute abundance together with low fishing mortality that minimized the confounding between natural and fishing mortality. Natural mortality is an important process that should be estimated when there is sufficient information to do so.},

Purpose of this guide is to assist you in producing quality maps by using fully-operational tools, without a need for serious additional investments. It will first introduce you the to the basic principles of geostatistical mapping and regression-kriging, as the key prediction technique, then it will guide you through four software packages: ILWIS GIS, R+gstat, SAGA GIS and Google Earth, which will be used to prepare the data, run analysis and make final layouts. These materials have been used for the five-days advanced training course "Hands-on-geostatistics: merging GIS and spatial statistics", that is regularly organized by the author and collaborators.

The animals were successfully maintained in captivity until sacrificed for up to 6 (one animal), 9 (one animal), 18 (the six animals from Naples), and 21 (17 animals) days. The number of increments counted in transverse stylet sections was 18.9 + 1.4 and 20.5 + 1.5 for octopuses maintained for 18 and 21 d, respectively. The mean rate of increment formation was 1.02 increments per day, suggesting a periodicity of 1 increment per day in the stylet.

Most authors now suggest that sustainability is best defined as the ability to sustain goods and services to human society, with social and economic factors to be considered along with environmental impacts. The result has been that each group (scientists, economists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), etc.) defines ``sustainable seafood'' using whatever criteria it considers most important, and the same fish product may be deemed sustainable by one group and totally unsustainable by another one. We contend, however, that there is now extensive evidence that an ecological focus alone does not guarantee long-term sustainability of any form and that seafood sustainability must consistently take on a socio-ecological perspective if it is to be effective across cultures and in the future. The sustainability of seafood production depends not on the abundance of a fish stock, but on the ability of the fishery management system to adjust fishing pressure to appropriate levels. While there are scientific standards to judge the sustainability of food production, once we examine ecological, social, and economic aspects of sustainability, there is no unique scientific standard.},

  abstract = {The Portuguese fishery in Portugal waters landed its greatest catches in the mid 1960s, and landings have remained lower but steady since then. Purse seines, targeting sardines (Sardina pilchardus), had the highest catches of all fisheries from 1950-1999. Fish and cephalopod trawls, crustacean trawls, and multi-gear vessels form the remaining fleets. During the 1990s, both the catch and value of most target species decreased slightly (except for octopus), due to decreasing fleet sizes in all fisheries. Official Portuguese catch statistics are compatible with ICES landing figures since the late 1980s. Prior to this period, Portuguese catch statistics are approximately 18\% lower. We assume Portuguese discard rates are low. The Portuguese fishery is dominated by purse seines, which generally have low discard rates. This contrasts with Spanish fishery, which has a greater trawling fleet and is thus more likely to produce higher discard rates. Surprisingly, the biomass of shark discards in Portuguese fishery is probably quite high, as they form a substantial proportion of the trawling fisheries catches, and are nearly always discarded.},

  abstract = {Beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) is one of the few commercially important fish species producing living offspring. Like many other deep-water fishes, it is slow growing, late maturing and long-lived, getting as old as 65 years or even 75 years in some populations. The stock in the Norwegian and Barents Seas is analytically assessed since 2012, assuming a natural mortality (M) of 0.05 yr- 1 across all ages, based on Hoenig's longevity related estimator. Since then, several reviews and new studies have been published, affording a re-evaluation of the natural mortality in the assessment model. We estimated natural mortality of beaked redfish using 48 different estimators in two categories, either estimating M across the population or dependent on age, length or weight. The obtained estimates were highly variable, ranging from 0.01 to 0.32 yr- 1 for estimates across the population, and 0.05--0.62 yr- 1 for age or size dependent median-M. These wide ranges demonstrate the sensitivity of SSB to the input parameters as well as the pitfalls of using estimators developed for distant taxa. Of the 48 estimates, 20 were considered as potential candidates for updating the stock assessment model, yet not all of these were realistic. The frequency distribution of the estimators showed a peak around a value of 0.07 yr- 1, lowering the estimated spawning stock biomass in the last year by about 300 kt but keeping it above the precautionary reference point for the stock. Estimators across the life-history of beaked redfish indicate a potential underes\- timation of natural mortality for early and overestimation for late age classes. Age and size related estimators are promising for the older ages but tend to extreme estimates for the early ages, which deserves further investigation.},

  abstract = {The values used for natural mortality (M) are very influential in stock assessment models, affecting model outcomes and management advice. Natural mortality is one of the most difficult demographic parameters to estimate, and there is often limited information about the true levels. Here, we summarise the evidence used to estimate natural mortality at age for the four main stocks of yellowfin tuna (Indian, Western and Central Pacific, Eastern Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans), including catch curves, tagging experiments, and maximum observed age. We identify important issues for estimating M such as variation with age linked to size, maturity state or senescence, and highlight information gaps. We describe the history of natural mortality values used in stock assessments by the tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations responsible for managing each stock and assess the evidence supporting these values. In June 2021, an online meeting was held by the Center for the Advancement of Population Assessment Methodology (CAPAM), to provide advice and guidance on practices for modelling natural mortality in fishery assessments. Based on approaches presented and discussed at the meeting, we develop a range of yellowfin tuna natural mortality estimates for each stock. We also recommend future research to improve these estimates of natural mortality.},

These patterns are an insidious problem, and can lead to severe errors when providing management advice. Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn's {$\rho$} (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn's {$\rho$} tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn's {$\rho$} differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn's {$\rho$} is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn's {$\rho$} which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

Mackerel were allowed to swim from a purse seine through a transfer channel into two identical large floating net-pens. One pen was used as a control and was left floating in the sea without further treatment. The other was used to simulate crowding and slipping. The volume of the pen was gradually decreased by hoisting the bottom of the pen using a crane until the fish started to show panic reactions, and this volume was maintained for 15 min (2006) or 10 min (2007). The volume was then allowed to return to normal and the net-pens were left to drift freely in the open sea for 3--6 days. Five repeat experiments were performed, all of which showed that crowding has a major effect on survival rates. In all five experiments, mortality was higher among the crowded fish (80--100\% mortality) than the controls (0.1--46\% mortality), and the difference was significant (p = 0.01). The experiments demonstrate that excessive crowding before slipping mackerel from purse seines should be avoided, if possible, in order to avoid massive fish kills.},

WGFTFB also collaborates with the Working Group on Fisheries, Acoustics, Science and Technology (WGFAST) to facilitate the interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and to foster cooperation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the group did not meet physically in 2020 and 2021. Whereas the 2020 meeting was cancelled, the 2021 group meeting was conducted solely online (organized by the planned host IMR Bergen/Norway). As originally scheduled for the 2020 meeting in Bergen/Norway, the current meeting was a joint meeting with the Working Group on Fisheries, Acoustics, Science and Technology (WGFAST). The working group's 2021 meeting included several plenum sessions and a Joint Workshop on Fishing Technology, Acoustics and Behaviour (JFTAB) with WGFAST. The three Topic Groups examined issues relating to passive gear, especially as it pertains to bycatch of protected species, the use of artificial lights for bycatch mitigation, and bycatch mitigation in large pelagic fisheries. In addition to the work conducted during the meeting, this document also contains the national reports describing activities in different countries. National reports are structured to give an overview of current and planned activities in the institutes and organizations of the county that are active in research in fishing gear and fish behaviour. They are an important tool to stimulate collaborative research by highlighting research themes and sharing of ideas that other countries might also benefit from. Current national reports cover a broad field of gear technology research, including research related to bycatch reduction of target and bycatch species (including ETP-species - endangered, threatened and protected species), minimizing the effect on the marine environment, pollution and energy efficiency. In addition to classical gear technology approaches, several projects are presented that focus on techniques, such as computer vision.},

These long-term monitoring surveys provide data for stock assessments and facilitate examination of changes in fish distribution and relative abundance. The group also promotes the standardization of fishing gears and methods as well as survey coordination. This report summarizes the national contributions in 2021--2022 and plans for the 2022--2023 surveys coordinated by IBTSWG. In the North Sea, the surveys are performed in quarters (Q) Q1 and Q3, while in the Northeast Atlantic the surveys are conducted in Q1, Q3, and Q4 with a suite of 14 national surveys covering a large area of continental shelf that extends from the north of Scotland to the Gulf of C{\'a}diz. North Sea surveys in 2022-Q1 were affected severely by mechanical and COVID-related issues, as well as the number of storms experienced during the survey period. Some of the ICES rectangles in the survey area could not be sampled and a larger number of the rectangles were only sampled with a single tow. North Sea surveys in 2021-Q3 were broadly complete, with the wider area surveyed and comparable number of hauls. However, some rectangles close to shore or with obstructions may not have had full coverage. Most of the surveys in the Northeast Atlantic were completed successfully. However, the two Spanish groundfish surveys in the Gulf of C{\'a}diz could not be undertaken in 2021. Vessel-related problems also affected the Spanish survey of the Cantabrian Sea, although this survey was completed using two vessels over a more protracted survey window. The IBTSWG welcomed the return of the Portuguese groundfish survey (Q4) after a two-year absence, with the survey being undertaken by the new research vessel, the ``Mario Ruivo''. IBTSWG discussed the roadmap for the new survey trawl, following on from the Workshop on the Further Development of the New IBTS Gear (WKFDN). IBTSWG agreed the main aspects of the new trawl, and will meet intersessionally to discuss and agree the final net plans. Trials are planned to start in late 2022 with the subsequent introduction of the trawl in the North Sea over the next few years. IBTSWG met with members of various assessment groups, including the Working Group on the Assessment of Demersal Stocks in the North Sea and Skagerrak (WGNSSK) and the Working Group for the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Waters Ecoregion (WGBIE) to discuss how closer cooperation could enhance the use of data outcomes. IBTSWG members subsequently gave presentations to some of the assessment working groups using the data collected under the auspices of IBTSWG and intends to incorporate feedback into the its work. The trawl surveys coordinated by IBTSWG also provide an important platform for the collection of additional data, including the sampling of sprat larvae, fish stomachs and fish parasites.},

  abstract = {WGCEPH worked on six Terms of Reference. These involved reporting on the status of stocks; reviewing advances in stock identification, assessment for fisheries management and for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), including some exploratory stock assessments; reviewing impacts of human activities on cephalopods; developing identification guides and recommendations for fishery data collection; describing the value chain and evaluating market drivers; and reviewing advances in research on environmental tolerance of cephalopods. ToR A is supported by an annual data call for fishery and survey data. During 2019--2021, compared to 1990--2020, cuttlefish remained the most important cephalopod group in terms of weight landed along the European North Atlantic coast, while loliginid squid overtook octopus as the second most important group. Short-finned squid remained the least important group in landings although their relative importance was almost double in 2019--2022 compared to 1992--2020. Total cephalopod landings have been fairly stable since 1992. Cuttlefish landings are towards the low end of the recent range, part of a general downward trend since 2004. Loliginid squid landings in 2019 were close to the maximum seen during the last 20 years but totals for 2020 and 2021 were lower. Annual ommastrephid squid landings are more variable than those of the other two groups and close to the maximum seen during 1992--2021. Octopod landings have generally declined since 2002 but the amount landed in 2021 was higher than in the previous four years. Under ToR B we illustrate that the combination of genetic analysis and statolith shape analysis is a promising method to provide some stock structure information for {$<$}em{$>$}L. forbsii{$<$}/em{$>$}. With the summary of cephalopod assessments, we could illustrate that many cephalopod species could already be included into the MSFD. We further provide material from two reviews in preparation, covering stock assessment methods and challenges faced for cephalopod fisheries management. Finally, we summarise trends in abundance indices, noting evidence of recent declines in cuttlefish and some octopuses of the genus {$<$}em{$>$}Eledone{$<$}/em{$>$}. Under ToR C, we describe progress on the reviews of (i) anthropogenic impacts on cephalopods and (ii) life history and ecology. In relation to life history, new information on {$<$}em{$>$}Eledone cirrhosa{$<$}/em{$>$} from Portugal is included. Under ToR D we provide an update on identification guides, discuss best practice in fishery data collection in relation to maturity determination and sampling intensity for fishery monitoring. Among others, we recommend i) to include the sampling of cephalopods in any fishery that (a) targets cephalopods, (b) targets both cephalopods and demersal fishes or (c) takes cephalopods as an important bycatch, ii) Size-distribution sampling, iii) the use of standardized sampling protocols, iv) an increased sampling effort in cephalopod. Work under ToR E on value chains and market drivers, in conjunction with the Cephs \&amp; Chefs INTERREG project, has resulted in two papers being submitted. Abstracts of these are in the report. Finally, progress under ToR F on environmental tolerance limits of cephalopods and climate envelope models is discussed, noting the need to continue this work during the next cycle.},

  abstract = {WGWIDE reports on the status and considerations for management of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel, blue whiting, Western and North Sea horse mackerel, Northeast Atlantic boarfish, Norwegian spring-spawning herring, striped red mullet (subareas 6, 8, and divisions 7.a--c, e--k and 9.a), and red gurnard (subareas 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) stocks.2024 catch advice was drafted for all eight stocks. Benchmark assessments are proposed for 2025 for mackerel, herring, and striped red mullet while both horse mackerel stocks and boarfish are scheduled to be benchmarked in 2024.\textbf{Northeast Atlantic mackerel.} This migratory stock is widely distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic with significant fisheries in several ICES subareas. The assessment conducted in 2023 is an update assessment, based on the configuration agreed during the 2019 interbenchmark and incorporates updates to the commercial catch, tagging, swept-area, egg survey, and recruitment index dataseries. Advice is given based on stock reference points which were updated during a management strategy evaluation carried out in 2020. SSB has been declining since 2014 but is above MSY B\textsubscript{trigger} in 2023. Fishing mortality has been increasing since 2016 and above F\textsubscript{MSY} since 2021.\textbf{Blue whiting.} This pelagic gadoid is widely distributed in the eastern part of the North Atlantic. The current assessment configuration (interbenchmark in 2016) uses preliminary catch and sampling data along with the acoustic survey data from the current year. The 2023 update assessment indicates that SSB is increasing following strong recent recruitment and is well above MSY B\textsubscript{trigger}. Fishing mortality has been above F\textsubscript{MSY} since 2014.\textbf{Norwegian spring-spawning herring. }This stock is migratory, spawning along the Norwegian coast and feeding throughout much of the Norwegian Sea. The 2023 update assessment is based on an implementation of the XSAM assessment model introduced following a benchmark in 2016 and is consistent with the 2022 assessment. SSB has been declining since 2009, except for an increase in 2021 which was due to the strong 2016 year class entering the SSB. Fishing mortality has been above F\textsubscript{MSY} since 2019. Recruitment since 2016 is estimated to be below average and SSB is forecast to fall below MSY B\textsubscript{trigger} in 2024 and decrease further in 2025 even if the management plan is applied in 2024.\textbf{Western horse mackerel}. The Western stock of horse mackerel is distributed throughout ICES subareas 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Following a benchmark in 2017, the stock is assessed using the Stock Synthesis (SS) integrated assessment model. Stock reference points were revised in 2019. Following a period of declining SSB, there has been a modest rise since 2017, albeit from a low level. The 2023 assessment indicates that SSB is below B\textsubscript{lim} and will remain so in 2025, even under the scenario of zero catch in 2024. Based on the MSY approach, advice for 2024 is therefore for zero catch. The assessment has been displaying significant retrospective bias, but the 2023 assessment is consistent with the 2022 assessment.\textbf{North Sea horse mackerel.} Catch advice for this stock is issued biennially on the basis of an assessment based on a combined index from groundfish surveys in the North Sea and the Channel. The 2023 value is an increase on the 2022 value for the exploitable stock. A length-based indicator continues to indicate that fishing mortality remains above F\textsubscript{MSY}.\textbf{Northeast Atlantic boarfish. }Boarfish is a small, pelagic, planktivorous, shoaling species found over much of the Northeast Atlantic shelf but primarily in ICES subareas 4, 6, 7, and 8. The directed fishery occurs primarily in the Celtic Sea and developed during the early 2000s, initially unregulated before the introduction of a TAC in 2011. The stock is assessed using an exploratory Bayesian surplus production model with catch and survey data from groundfish surveys and an acoustic survey. The current assessment indicates that, following a sharp decline after 2012, biomass has been increasing in recent years. The most recent acoustic surveys indicate a period of above-average recruitment in recent years. A length-based indicator indicates that fishing mortality is below F\textsubscript{MSY}.\textbf{Northeast Atlantic red gurnard. }This stock was first considered by WGWIDE in\textbf{ }2016 with advice issued biennially. The assessment was benchmarked in 2021 and a survey-based relative biomass indicator was developed. The 2023 update assessment continues to show the indicator fluctuating without trend since 2010. However, large uncertainties remain regarding landings data due to poor resolution at the species level and reported discarding levels vary widely.\textbf{Striped red mullet in Bay of Biscay, Southern Celtic Seas, Atlantic Iberian waters.} No assessment is available for this stock and information on abundance and exploitation level is limited with advice given triennially on the basis of the precautionary approach. However, there are a number of research projects underway which will inform a future benchmark and potential upgrade of the assessment category.},

  abstract = {WGWIDE reports on the status and considerations for management of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel, blue whiting, Western and North Sea horse mackerel, Northeast Atlantic boarfish, Norwegian spring-spawning herring, striped red mullet (Subareas 6, 8 and Divisions 7.a-c, e-k and 9.a), and red gurnard (Subareas 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) stocks.~ 2023 catch advice was drafted for mackerel, Western horse mackerel, blue whiting and herring. For the remainder, multi-annual catch advice was previously published. Benchmark assessments are proposed for 2024 for mackerel, both horse mackerel stocks, herring and striped red mullet with boarfish is scheduled to be benchmarked in 2023. Prior to any benchmark assessment for mackerel, WGWIDE recommends that a workshop to review the latest knowledge with regard to the stock component structure takes place. Northeast Atlantic Mackerel. This migratory stock is widely distributed throughout the North-east Atlantic with significant fisheries in several ICES subareas. The assessment conducted in 2022 is an update assessment, based on the configuration agreed during the 2019 inter-benchmark and incorporates updates to the commercial catch, tagging, swept area and egg sur-vey (preliminary) data series. No recruitment index is available for the 2021 year-class as survey coverage was inadequate. Advice is given based on stock reference points which were updated during a management strategy evaluation carried out in 2020. Following a decline since 2014, SSB has been stable (above MSY Btrigger) since 2019. Fishing mortality has been increasing since 2016 and is above FMSY since 2020. Blue Whiting. This pelagic gadoid is widely distributed in the eastern part of the North Atlantic. The current assessment configuration (inter-benchmark in 2016) uses preliminary catch and sampling data along with the acoustic survey data from the current year. The 2022 update as-sessment indicates that SSB is increasing following strong recent recruitment and is well above MSY Btrigger. Fishing mortality has been above FMSY since 2014 but is falling. Norwegian Spring Spawning Herring. This stock is migratory, spawning along the Norwegian coast and feeding throughout much of the Norwegian Sea. The 2022 update assessment is based on an implementation of the XSAM assessment model introduced following a benchmark in 2016 and is consistent with the 2021 assessment. Following a period of decline since 2009, SSB has been relatively stable just above MSY Btrigger in recent years, due to the strong 2016 year-class. However, recruitment since 2016 is estimated to be below average and the stock size is forecast to fall below MSY Btrigger in 2024. Western Horse Mackerel. The western stock of horse mackerel is distributed throughout ICES subareas 4,6,7,8 and 9. Following a benchmark in 2017, the stock is assessed using the Stock Synthesis integrated assessment model. Stock reference points were revised in 2019. Following a period of declining SSB, there has been a modest rise since 2017, albeit from a low level. The 2022 assessment indicates that SSB is below Blim and will remain so in 2024, even under the scenario of zero catch in 2023. Based on the MSY approach, advice for 2024 is therefore for zero catch. The assessment continues to display significant retrospective issues which should be investigated by a benchmark assessment. North Sea Horse Mackerel. Catch advice for this stock is issued biennially on the basis of an assessment based on a combined index from groundfish surveys in the North Sea and the Channel. No survey index was available in 2020 due to restricted survey coverage, and the 2021 value is a reduction on the 2019 value for the exploitable stock. A length based indicator continues to indicate that fishing mortality remains above FMSY. Northeast Atlantic Boarfish. Boarfish is a small, pelagic, planktivorous, shoaling species, found over much of the Northeast Atlantic shelf but primarily in ICES subareas 4,6,7 and 8. The directed fishery occurs primarily in the Celtic Sea and developed during the early 2000s, initially unregulated before the introduction of a TAC in 2011. The stock is assessed using an exploratory Bayesian surplus production model with catch and survey data from groundfish surveys and an acoustic survey. The current assessment indicates that, following a sharp decline after 2012, biomass has been increasing in recent years. The most recent acoustic surveys indicate a period of above average recruitment from 2018-2020. Northeast-Atlantic Red Gurnard. This stock was first considered by WGWIDE in 2016 with advice issued biennially. The assessment was benchmarked in 2021 and a survey-based relative biomass indicator was developed. The 2022 update assessment continues to show the indicator fluctuating without trend since 2010. However, large uncertainties remain with regard to land-ings data due to poor resolution at the species level and reported discarding levels vary widely.~ Striped Red Mullet in Bay of Biscay, Southern Celtic Seas, Atlantic Iberian Waters. No as-sessment is available for this stock and information on abundance and exploitation level is limited with advice given triennially on the basis of the precautionary approach. However, there are a number of research projects underway which will inform a future benchmark and potential upgrade of the assessment category.},

  abstract = {The ICES Working Group on Southern horse mackerel, anchovy and sardine (WGHANSA) assessed the status of anchovy in Atlantic Iberian waters (ane.27.9a; western and southern components) and horse mackerel in Atlantic Iberian waters (hom.27.9a) in the May meeting. The status of anchovy in Bay of Biscay (ane.27.8), sardine in southern Celtic Seas and the English Channel (pil.27.7), sardine in Bay of Biscay (pil.27.8abd), sardine in Cantabrian Sea and Atlantic Iberian waters (pil.27.8c9a) and jack mackerel in Subdivision 10.a.2 (Azores grounds) (jaa.27.10a2) was assessed in the November meeting.~ The stock of {$<$}strong{$>$}anchovy in Bay of Biscay{$<$}/strong{$>$} (ane.27.8) has been above Blim since the reopening of the fishery in 2010. SSB in 2022 has been estimated as the third highest of the historical series. Recruitment (age 1 biomass at the beginning of the year) in 2023 is estimated above the average of the time-series. Harvest rates (catch/SSB) have been stable in the last years. The stock of {$<$}strong{$>$}anchovy in Atlantic Iberian waters{$<$}/strong{$>$} (ane.27.9a) is composed by the western component (distributed in areas 9.a North, Central--North, and Central--South) and the southern component (distributed in area 9.a South). The advice is provided for the two components separately for the management calendar from July to June next year. For the western component, the index ratio (1-over-2 rule) based on the PELACUS and PELAGO surveys shows an 83\% increase of the stock in 2022 compared with the mean of the two previous years, and the 80\% uncertainty cap is applied. For the southern component, the relative SSB from an analytical assessment conducted with GADGET is used as the index of stock size development. The index ratio (1-over-2 rule) indicates that the relative SSB in 2022 is 71\% lower than in the two previous years. Given that in 2022 the stock component size is below Blim, a biomass safeguard has been considered. In the last years {$<$}strong{$>$}sardine in the Bay of Biscay{$<$}/strong{$>$} (pil.27.8abd) shows a decreasing trend in SSB. In 2022 spawning-stock biomass is estimated below MSY Btrigger, Bpa and above Blim. Since 2013 the fishing mortality has been oscillating above FMSY and Fpa, and below Flim.~ The advice for {$<$}strong{$>$}sardine in southern Celtic Seas and the English Channel{$<$}/strong{$>$} (pil.27.7) is based on the PELTIC survey biomass index in the total area. Due to technical reasons, this year the coverage of the survey was incomplete and an estimate of the biomass in the total area was obtained by raising the estimate from the area covered in 2022 to the total area based on historical proportions. The index ratio indicates an increase of 20\% in 2022 compared with the two previous years.~ The biomass (age 1+) of {$<$}strong{$>$}sardine in Atlantic Iberian waters{$<$}/strong{$>$} (pil.27.8c9a) in 2022 is estimated to be above MSY Btrigger, Bpa and Blim for the third consecutive year. Fishing mortality in 2021 is slightly above FMSY but is among the lowest of the time-series. ICES advice is based on the ICES MSY advice rule. However, the catch options explored for 2023 include several harvest control rules that were assessed by ICES as precautionary.~ The SSB of {$<$}strong{$>$}horse mackerel in Atlantic Iberian waters{$<$}/strong{$>$} (hom.27.9a) fluctuated from 1992 (the beginning of the assessment) to 2013 and afterwards has increased continuously to historical maximum values in 2022. In 2022 SSB is estimated at 1 155 488 tonnes, well above MSY Btrigger, Bpa, and Blim. ~Fishing mortality has been below FMSY over the whole time-series, with a decreasing trend in the last years. Since 2018, recruitment is considered very uncertain due to the lack of the survey index in 2019 and 2020.~ The {$<$}strong{$>$}jack mackerel in Subdivision 10.a.2 (Azores grounds){$<$}/strong{$>$} (jaa.10.a2) is classified in category 5 and advice is provided biannually. The stock and exploitation status relative to MSY and precautionary approach (PA) reference points cannot be assessed. Given that there is no ancillary information clearly indicating that the current level of exploitation is appropriate for the stock, the 20\% precautionary buffer was applied to provide advice for 2023 and 2024.},

  abstract = {WGCEPH worked on six Terms of Reference. These involved reporting on the status of stocks; reviewing advances in stock identification, assessment for fisheries management and for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), including some exploratory stock assessments; reviewing impacts of human activities on cephalopods; developing identification guides and recommendations for fishery data collection; describing the value chain and evaluating market drivers; and reviewing advances in research on environmental tolerance of cephalopods. ToR A is supported by an annual data call for fishery and survey data. During 2019--2021, compared to 1990--2020, cuttlefish remained the most important cephalopod group in terms of weight landed along the European North Atlantic coast, while loliginid squid overtook octopus as the second most important group. Short-finned squid remained the least important group in landings although their relative importance was almost double in 2019--2022 compared to 1992--2020. Total cephalopod landings have been fairly stable since 1992.~ Cuttlefish landings are towards the low end of the recent range, part of a general downward trend since 2004. Loliginid squid landings in 2019 were close to the maximum seen during the last 20 years but totals for 2020 and 2021 were lower. Annual ommastrephid squid landings are more variable than those of the other two groups and close to the maximum seen during 1992--2021. Octopod landings have generally declined since 2002 but the amount landed in 2021 was higher than in the previous four years. Under ToR B we illustrate that the combination of genetic analysis and statolith shape analysis is a promising method to provide some stock structure information for {$<$}em{$>$}L. forbsii{$<$}/em{$>$}. With the summary of cephalopod assessments, we could illustrate that many cephalopod species could already be included into the MSFD. We further provide material from two reviews in preparation, covering stock assessment methods and challenges faced for cephalopod fisheries management. Finally, we summarise trends in abundance indices, noting evidence of recent declines in cuttlefish and some octopuses of the genus {$<$}em{$>$}Eledone{$<$}/em{$>$}. Under ToR C, we describe progress on the reviews of (i) anthropogenic impacts on cephalopods and (ii) life history and ecology. In relation to life history, new information on {$<$}em{$>$}Eledone cirrhosa{$<$}/em{$>$} from Portugal is included. Under ToR D we provide an update on identification guides, discuss best practice in fishery data collection in relation to maturity determination and sampling intensity for fishery monitoring. Among others, we recommend i) to include the sampling of cephalopods in any fishery that (a) targets cephalopods, (b) targets both cephalopods and demersal fishes or (c) takes cephalopods as an important bycatch, ii) Size-distribution sampling, iii) the use of standardized sampling protocols, iv) an increased sampling effort in cephalopod.~ Work under ToR E on value chains and market drivers, in conjunction with the Cephs \&amp; Chefs INTERREG project, has resulted in two papers being submitted. Abstracts of these are in the report. Finally, progress under ToR F on environmental tolerance limits of cephalopods and climate envelope models is discussed, noting the need to continue this work during the next cycle.},

  abstract = {The Working Group on Biological Parameters (WGBIOP) approved the realization of a new workshop on age reading of European anchovy to discuss the results of the exchange conducted in 2018 and the development of validation studies in this species. Particularly, the workshop previously scheduled for 2020 has been proposed for 2021 (ICES, 2020). The third Workshop on Age Reading of European Anchovy (WKARA3), chaired by Gualtiero Basilone (Italy) and held from 23 to 25 November 2021, was an online meeting due to the persistence of the pandemic situation. Six countries took part in this workshop (Spain, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Portugal and France), with a total of 26 participants from 12 laboratories [(IEO (Santander, Palma de Mallorca, C{\'a}diz and Malaga), AZTI, CNR-IAS, CNR-IRBIM, CIBM, COISPA, UNIPARTENOPE, UNICA, IOF, HCMR, IPMA, and Ifremer]. Fourteen of the participants in this workshop are readers for the assessment of anchovy. In total 16 areas/stocks were considered for evaluation, particularly 4 from the Atlantic Ocean and 12 from the Mediterranean Sea. The workshop was focused on the review of information on anchovy age estimations, otolith exchanges, workshops and validation studies done the information on age determination; on analysis and discussion of the results of the previous exchange (2018); on the review of the validation methods existing for the target species ({$<$}em{$>$}Engraulis encrasicolus{$<$}/em{$>$}); and update the age reading protocol. This workshop was preceded by an otolith exchange (2018), as well as a Workshop on Age estimation of Small Pelagic (WKGESP 2019) in Italy supported by the Italian national fishery data collection plan (Basilone {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$}., 2019). The main conclusions achieved by both meetings have been presented during the WKARA3.~ The otolith exchange programme was focused on two areas (Bay of Biscay and Strait of Sicily) and produced comparable results in both study places. Particularly, the overall agreement between readers and areas is lower than in the previous exchange held in 2014. Moreover, in both areas results from the stock readers group are better than the other groups of readers (including advanced and expert groups) Finally, the growth pattern is commonly identified in both Bay of Biscay and the Strait of Sicily. The main results of the WKGESP were a new otoliths reference collection (on a national basis) and standardizing age assignments to improve the coherence of age estimation among the participant laboratories. Finally, the WKAGESP group adopted 1 January as the conventional birthdate for anchovy, since the main discrepancy between labs was represented by the adoption of 1 January or 1 July as the species birthdate.~ During the second day of the workshop, a new otolith exchange program was set up to integrate and complete the old database. The proposal suggests sharing about 200 otoliths, stratified by area (i.e. the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea) as well as for embedding medium (i.e. water or resin).~ As recommended by WKARA2 (ICES, 2017) as well as the last exchange program, age validation studies should be conducted for all anchovy stocks, especially those that are assessed analytically, since the validation of the annual deposition of seasonal zones and the checks in the otolith allow to improve the aging precision. For such reasons, some validation studies have been conducted on anchovy stocks in both Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. Particularly, an age validation study was conducted in the Gulf of C{\'a}diz with the objectives to validate the periodicity of the otolith increment formation through the otolith marginal increment (MIA) and the otolith edge analysis (EA), and to evaluate the temporal link between the reproductive cycle and the somatic conditions with the otolith edge formation and the patterns of monthly increments. For the Strait of Sicily, the results of published research were presented (Basilone {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$}., 2020). A statistical modelling approach has been here adopted to assess the coherence of two well-known methods, namely Edge Analysis and Marginal Increment Analysis, to validate the first annulus formation in European anchovy. Both methodologies in two different yearly cycles converged toward the same result, thus confirming the annulus identification for the first-year class. In addition, the completion dates of the checks and the first annulus were computed to gain a better insight into otolith growth dynamic. The obtained results corroborated temporally coherent patterns providing a better insight into the otolith growth dynamic as well as a more robust validation of the first annulus formation in the European anchovy. Finally, a preliminary validation on anchovy stock inhabiting the South Tyrrhenian Sea was presented during the WKARA3, according to the experience the researcher already obtained by validation on {$<$}em{$>$}Mullus barbatus{$<$}/em{$>$} (Carbonara {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$}., 2018). The work done assigning the age according to the criteria by Carbonara and Follesa (2019), then the growth parameter of the von Bertalanffy curve (VBGC) was estimated for males and females, later VBGC parameters for each sex were compared to identify a possible sexual dimorphism. On the last day, the workshop proceeded with a detailed and joint discussion on the growth patterns shown by otoliths from the different areas, proposed by attendees to the meeting. This common examination and discussion of otoliths by areas allowed finding out the major reasons for discrepancies in age determination among readers and a better understanding of the pattern of otolith growth increments by areas to improve the guidelines for their interpretation (ToR b). Such an exercise served to enhance the collections of agreed-aged otoliths (ToR d), as well as to highlight the importance of a new exchange program.~ The discussions on examples among the set of otoliths which generated the discrepancies in the age determination led to conclude that mainly source of disagreement is linked to a divergent otolith interpretation. Particularly, different interpretations of the marks, growth bands and edges through their conformity with the expected growth pattern of the anchovies, seasonal formation of the otolith by age and most common checks. The importance of technical advice on storage was also highlighted. In fact, before embedding them in resin or before placing them in cuvettes, readers should be ensured that the otolith is completely dry. Moreover, this discussion strongly encouraged each lab area to conduct validation studies by different techniques as reported in Basilone {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$}. (2020).~ In conclusion of the former statements, a new exchange exercise has been planned for after 2022, also suggesting two new chairs who will join the coordination with Gualtiero Basilone. Similarly, to improve the coherence of the age estimates among Atlantic and Mediterranean areas and corroborate the kindly suggested studies of validation, the group recommend a new WKARA in 2023, which will be chaired by new coordinators together with the former one (G. Basilone).},

The standardization of the fishing power and fishing effort of 17 tuna vessels began with a principal component analysis applied to a correlation matrix calculated for purse seine length, height, and area, carrying capacity, vessel length, tonnage, and beam. The first principal component explained 72.58\% of the variance and was used to develop a multiple linear regression model from which the mathematical expression to standardize fishing power (FP) was derived: FPvessel = 1 + (1.84 {$\cdot$} 12.10-1) {$\cdot$} C1. Fishing effort was standardized by multiplying the fishing power by the nominal effort of each vessel. Maps of the spatial distribution of these efforts as indicators of fishing grounds were then created. The highest concentration of fishing effort occurred between 2{\textopenbullet} and 4{\textopenbullet} N, and from the coastline to 82{\textopenbullet} W, coinciding with fishing grounds known as ``Banco Tumaco'', ``Pasacaballos'', and ``Banco Colombia'' in the southeastern part of the colombian Exclusive Economic Zone.},

The three independent sources of data all show that there is a significant relationship between the timing of spawning and sea surface temperature. Large mackerel are shown to arrive at the feeding areas before and leave later than small mackerel and the sequential appearance of mackerel in each of the feeding areas studied supports the anecdotal evidence for an eastward postspawning migration. Occasional commercial catches taken in winter in the Sound N, Kattegat and Skagerrak together with catches in the first quarter IBTS survey furthermore indicate some overwintering here. Significant relationships between temperature and North Sea mackerel spawning and migration have not been documented before. The results have implications for mackerel resource management and monitoring. An increase in temperature is likely to affect the timing and magnitude of the growth, recruitment and migration of North Sea mackerel with subsequent impacts on its sustainable exploitation. \& 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of using the ensemble modelling paradigm to fully capture assessment uncertainty and improve the robustness of advice provision. We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientific advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of fish populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the ``best'' model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model configurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

The methodology was tested with stochastic simulations for different degrees of connectivity between sub-populations and applied to two case studies, North Sea cod (Gadus morua) and Northeast Atlantic sardine (Sardina pilchardus). Considering that the biological components of a population can be partitioned into discrete spatial units, we extended this idea into a property of additivity of sub-population abundances. If the additivity results hold true for putative sub-populations, then assessment results based on sub-populations will provide information to develop and monitor the implementation of finer scale/local management. The simulation study confirmed that when sub-populations are independent and not too heterogeneous with regards to productivity, the sum of stock assessment model estimates of sub-populations' SSB is similar to the SSB estimates of the meta-population. It also showed that a strong diffusion process can be detected and that the stronger the connection between SSB and recruitment, the better the diffusion process will be detected. On the other hand it showed that weak to moderate diffusion processes are not easy to identify and large differences between sub-populations productivities may be confounded with weak diffusion processes. The application to North Sea cod and Atlantic sardine exemplified how much insight can be gained. In both cases the results obtained were sufficiently robust to support the regional analysis.},

  abstract = {The spatial behavior of numerous fishing fleets is nowadays well documented thanks to satellite Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS). Vessel positions are recorded on a frequent and regular basis which opens promising perspectives for improving fishing effort estimation and management. However, no specific information is provided on whether the vessel is fishing or not. To answer that question, existing works on VMS data usually apply simple criteria (e.g. threshold on speed). Those simple criteria generally focus in detecting true positives (a true fishing set detected as a fishing set); conversely, estimation errors are given no attention. For our case study, the Peruvian anchovy fishery, those criteria overestimate the total number of fishing sets by 182\%. To overcome this problem an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is presented here. In order to set both the optimal parameterization and use ``rules'' for this ANN, we perform an extensive sensitivity analysis on the optimization of (1) the internal structure and training algorithm of the ANN and (2) the ``rules'' used for choosing both the relative size and the composition of the databases (DBs) used for training and inferring with the ANN. The ``optimized'' ANN greatly improves the estimates of the number and location of fishing events. For our case study, ANN reduces the total estimation error on the number of fishing sets to 1\% (in average) and obtains 76\% of true positives. This spatially explicit information on effort, provided with error estimation, should greatly reduce misleading interpretations of catch per unit effort and thus significantly improve the adaptive management of fisheries. While fitted on Peruvian anchovy fishery data, this type of neural network approach has wider potential and could be implemented in any fishery relying on both VMS and at-sea observer data. In order to increase the accuracy of the ANN results, we also suggest some criteria for improving sampling design by at-sea observers and VMS data.},

Some 2472 specimens were analysed, with total lengths from 10.4 to 31.9 cm. Although females outnumbered males in summer, males were more abundant in the sex ratio (1.36 : 1). Based on the monthly evolution of the gonado-somatic index and the proportion of mature individuals, the spawning season occurred between January and April, peaking in February. Lengths at first maturity (LFM) were calculated from the maturity ogives by the Gompertz model for all specimens (22.79 cm), for males (21.20 cm) and for females (23.05 cm). In this area the minimum legal size for T. picturatus is actually smaller than the length at first maturity and should be revised to avoid depletion of the stock.},

No temporal or spatial genetic differentiation was detected. A few statistically significant pairwise differences were most probably of stochastic nature, since they do not reveal any specific pattern. The lack of genetic differentiation in horse mackerel probably reflects the large population size and lack of barriers to the gene flow. However, this result should be viewed with caution, given the relatively low number of loci used in this study.},

  abstract = {The genetic structure of the European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) was assessed throughout its geographic range using 5 microsatellite loci. One of the loci seemed to be under hitchhiking selection and exhibited a latitudinal cline along the eastern Atlantic, with abrupt change in allele frequencies from the Alboran Sea to the western Mediterranean and from the east Atlantic coast to the Azores and Madeira. This pattern was very similar to that previously described for the allozymic locus SOD* and these 2 loci could be linked. A Bayesian analysis of environmental factors with the genetic data indicated temperature as a potential selection factor. Selection pressure may be stronger at the southern limit of sardine distribution, because heterozygosity of the non-neutral locus was much lower there. The abrupt change in allele frequencies of the non-neutral locus in certain regions seem to be related more to strong barriers to gene flow, which were not evident for neutral loci, than to abrupt changes in selection pressure. These areas of discontinuity provide a guideline to define and delineate genetic stocks and are generally consistent with areas of phenotypic change in sardine, but they are not in concordance with the currently recognized morphological subspecies.},

  abstract = {The EU purse seine fleet catches of skipjack tuna (SKJ; Katsuwonus pelamis) from the Indian Ocean were standardized using the framework described in Katara et al (2016). The analysis was restricted to fishing sets related with floating objects (FOBs), due to the strong associative behaviour of species and the FOB-oriented strategy of the fleet. Two definitions for Catch per unit of Effort (CPUE) were explored, i) a more traditional catch per fishing hour and ii) an alternative catch per fishing set. The time series for both CPUEs were standardised for two different periods: one for the whole time series (1985-2016), and one for the more recent years (2004-2016), because the length of the time series of available covariates, differed. In the latter case (2004-2016), the lasso -- least absolute shrinkage and selection operator- method was applied for data mining and model selection. The results are four standardised skipjack CPUE time series for floating object fishing, all of them showing similar trends. The time series for the two CPUEs based on different definitions of effort (fishing hours vs fishing set) are comparable, both showing a decreasing trend. The values are lower than the nominal CPUE values, possible due to accounting for unfished areas.},

Ages were difficult to determine for three-lined tongue sole (Cynoglossus abbreviates) and ridged-eye flounder (Pleuronichthys cornutus) because the first year annulus ring was often indistinct; therefore, we used directional change in otolith growth to distinguish it. Sectioning and etching methods were powerful tools for identifying annual checks for red tongue sole (Cynoglossus joyneri). Using these ageing methods, we determined age--length relationships and growth curves. The age composition of the populations studied and of the landings showed that a large proportion of the latter consisted of individuals under the mean age of sexual maturity, thereby reducing the percent spawning potential ratio (\%SPR) to {$\approx$} 20\% for all species. These findings suggest that fishing pressure on immature fish is leading to overfishing of these flatfish stocks.},

  abstract = {The reproductive biology of roundnose grenadier               Coryphaenoides rupestris               was investigated against a background of increasing commercial exploitation. Samples were taken from surveys carried out in Rockall Trough between 1993 and 1995. An eight-point maturity scale was developed based on both visual inspection of the ovaries and histological screening. The various stages of development of roundnose grenadier oocytes were described and the relative proportion of oocyte types and their respective size range in each maturity stage were investigated. The dynamic organization of the ovary indicated a determinate maturation cycle in this species. Population spawning appears to be prolonged, extending from July to at least November. However, data were insufficient to clarify individual spawning duration. The potential fecundity of 29 mature fish ranged from 11 083-55 175 (63-95 cm total length). The results were very similar to previous values from the North Atlantic. The reproductive strategy of the roundnose grenadier is discussed in the light of the current commercial exploitation of the Species.},

  abstract = {Computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) has been used to analyse the effects of cadmium and zinc on the motility of fish sperm treated either for 24 h after partial dilution in an extender, or during the final dilution step on the microscope stage during video recording. The progressive motility of catfish sperm, which was not affected by storage for 24 h, was decreased after exposure to 100 ppm cadmium or 2000 ppm zinc in extender for 24 h. Only 1000 ppm cadmium or 2000 ppm zinc had any effect on motility when added to sperm at the final dilution stage. These results suggest that concentrations of cadmium which have been found to be present in fish gonads as a result of bioaccumulation from the water or diet may decrease the motility of sperm during maturation or storage in the testis. Cadmium toxicity was significantly decreased in the presence of an equal amount of zinc, suggesting an equilibrium between zinc and cadmium at binding sites in the sperm. Computer assisted sperm analysis is shown for the first time to provide a rapid and quantitative measure of the effects of environmental pollutants on the quality of fish sperm. It is suggested that the methodology described may form the basis for a standard toxicity test to assess the potential hazards of environmental pollutants on reproduction.},

  abstract = {CMSY++, an improved version of the CMSY approach developed from Catch-MSY which uses a Bayesian implementation of a modified Schaefer model and can predict stock status and exploitation, was used in the present study. Evaluating relative performance is vital in situations when dealing with fisheries with different catch time series start years and biological prior information. To identify the influences of data inputs on CMSY++ outputs, this paper evaluated the use of a nominal reported catch and a reconstructed catch dataset of the South Atlantic blue shark alongside different priors of the blue shark's productivity/resilience (r) coupled with different indices of abundance. Results from the present study showed that different catch time series start years did not have a significant influence on the estimation of the biomass and fishing reference points reported by CMSY++. However, uninformative priors of r affected the output results of the model. The developed model runs with varying and joint abundance indices showed conflicting results, as classification rates in the final year changed with respect to the type of index used. However, the model runs indicated that South Atlantic blue shark stock could be overfished (B2020/Bmsy = 0.623 to 1.15) and that overfishing could be occurring (F2020/Fmsy = 0.818 to 1.78). This result is consistent with the results from a previous assessment using a state-space surplus production model applied for the same stock in 2015. Though some potential could be observed when using CMSY++, the results from this model ought to be taken with caution. Additionally, the continuous development of prior information useful for this model would help strengthen its performance.},

  abstract = {Rebuilding of exploited fish stocks at low biomass requires accurate mortality estimates. Weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) abundance is at historical lows caused by an increasing instantaneous total mortality (Z) in recent years, but uncertainty exists regarding the relative importance of instantaneous fishing mortality (F) and natural mortality (M) to Z. Data from a tag-return study and catch-curve of weakfish in North Carolina were analyzed jointly using a Bayesian statistical framework to estimate seasonal and annual mortality (i.e., F, M, and Z). We accounted for key auxiliary parameters in the tag-return portion of the model (i.e., tag-reporting rate and tag loss) through field studies and an experimental design, including use of high-reward tags and double tagging. Estimates of Z from the joint model were similar in magnitude to the weakfish stock assessment. From mid-2014 to 2017, we estimated a constant annual instantaneous mortality rate of 0.05 yr-1 (95 \% credible interval [CrI]: 0.04, 0.07) for F and 2.33 yr-1 (CrI: 2.10, 2.6) for M. In the most recent stock assessment, estimates of M had an upper bound of 1.0; thus, our findings suggest that these estimates of M are biased low and F biased high. Our seasonal analyses showed that a large portion of mortality occurred from fall to spring, coinciding with weakfish migration and overwintering periods on the continental shelf. Through an integrated modeling approach, our study provides insights into the magnitude, timing, and sources of weakfish mortality, and enhances understanding of weakfish population dynamics to guide management strategies.},

  abstract = {Seasonal experimental trawl surveys were carried out in the Northern Aegean and Thracian seas (NE Mediterranean, Greece), from summer 1990 to autumn 1993, during which a total of 172 fish species were caught. In these areas, fishing pressure is very high, since approximately 50\% of the Greek otter trawl fleet operates there, producing more than 57\% of the total demersal landings. Different statistics were used to assess spatial structure, seasonal changes and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages on the continental shelf and upper slope. The following measures were applied to the species abundance matrix: species diversity, species richness, evenness and dominance. The analysis of 501 bottom trawls revealed that, in general, species diversity, richness and evenness decreased with water depth, with the highest values at depths {$<$}100 m, whereas dominance increased with depth, with its maximum at depths {$>$}200 m. The effect of depth on the diversity patterns observed was always significant, while seasonal trends were similar with those described for the overall diversity characteristics in each area. Classification and ordination methods showed the existence of 4 groups associated with the continental shelf and upper slope in each area. Classification of the top ranking species at each group and area revealed that commercially important species were dominant in the shallowest zone ({$<$}30 m), while non-commercial species predominated at depths below 200 m. At intermediate depths (30-200 m) almost 50\% of the total catches were composed of non-commercially important fish species. However, since most species had a wide distribution range these differences were rather quantitative than qualitative. The results indicated that although spatial changes in abundance could be detected, temporal changes were not obvious. Environmental variability and overexploitation, as well as differences in species' life-history strategies, have both influenced the structure of the demersal fish assemblages found along the depth gradient studied.},

In these areas, fishing pressure is very high, since approximately 50\% of the Greek otter trawl fleet operates there, producing more than 57\% of the total demersal landings. Different statistics were used to assess spatial structure, seasonal changes and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages on the continental shelf and upper slope. The following measures were applied to the species abundance matrix: species diversity, species richness, evenness and dominance. The analysis of 501 bottom trawls revealed that, in general, species diversity, richness and evenness decreased with water depth, with the highest values at depths {$<$}100 m, whereas dominance increased with depth, with its maximum at depths {$>$}200 m. The effect of depth on the diversity patterns observed was always significant, while seasonal trends were similar with those described for the overall diversity characteristics in each area. Classification and ordination methods showed the existence of 4 groups associated with the continental shelf and upper slope in each area. Classification of the top ranking species at each group and area revealed that commercially important species were dominant in the shallowest zone ({$<$}30 m), while non-commercial species predominated at depths below 200 m. At intermediate depths (30-200 m) almost 50\% of the total catches were composed of non-commercially important fish species. However, since most species had a wide distribution range these differences were rather quantitative than qualitative. The results indicated that although spatial changes in abundance could be detected, temporal changes were not obvious. Environmental variability and overexploitation, as well as differences in species' life-history strategies, have both influenced the structure of the demersal fish assemblages found along the depth gradient studied.},

  abstract = {Long-term trends in Portuguese fisheries landing profiles of biodiversity, assemblage composition, trophic groups and marine trophic index (1950--2009) were studied to understand the evolution of the fisheries from an ecological viewpoint and evaluate the effects of fisheries on stocks. The number of species landed has increased considerably since the 1980s. This indicates an expansion of the fisheries and also a better use of the marine biodiversity for redistributing effort. Changes in the ecological composition of fisheries catches have occurred since the 1950s, with a significant shift in the middle 1980s (anchor point). Deep-sea resources and higher trophic levels (cephalopods, large benthopelagics, flatfishes, demersal invertebrates, small-medium and large rays, medium bathydemersal, shrimps, small benthopelagics large sharks) have increased while traditional commercial species captured by nearshore fisheries (medium and small pelagics) have decreased. Despite the decreasing trend in catches since 1988, the marine trophic index (MTI = 3.04) increased by approximately 0.2 units per decade (MTI in 2009 = 3.46). The number of collapsed, overexploited and fully exploited stocks has increased considerably over the last 20 years ({$>$}50\%). Overall, the data indicate that redistributing fishing effort and targeting of deep-sea resources may have been driven by depletion of inshore fishery stocks, which signals concern for the fishery. Marine biodiversity indexes and ecological structure of landings profiles should be considered by fishery managers when redefining new marine fisheries policy.},

  abstract = {In southern Portugal, artisanal octopus fisheries play an important socioeconomic role. Live crab bait in traps was used up to 2010 and banned in 2012. Such regulation, based on co-management advice, was not established under a scientific fundament. As a result, a long-standing controversy ensued with some fishing associations claiming that live crab bait increased fishing effort and exploitation rates and therefore risked the octopus stock status, while other fishers denied all these alleged impacts. The issue has not been resolved so far due to lack of scientific studies. In this study, we resolve the controversy conducting experimental fishing to determine by-catch and octopus catch rates using live crab bait versus other types of baits based on fish and assess the stock status of octopus over-time with constant parameters (hypothesis of no effect of the use of live crab bait) versus time-varying parameters (hypothesis of raised exploitation rates and riskier stock status). Bycatch was very low regardless of bait type. Our experimental fishing trials showed that fish-based baits increase bycatch and octopus catch rates. Stock assessment models showed that exploitation rates and stock status do not worsen in years of use of crab bait. We conclude that the use of crab bait in octopus fishery does not lead to increased exploitation rate or risks for stock sustainability status. Other considerations involving fishing costs and fishing operations further highlight the advantages of lifting the ban on the use of live crab bait in the Algarve octopus fishery.},

Fishing effort influenced catch rates in all areas with a 2 year lag and fishing pressure for each area was related to specific fleet sectors effort. In IXaCN, winter upwelling (spawning peak) and both summer northerly wind and wind magnitude (outside of the spawning peak) were strongly correlated with catch rates. In IXaCS summer/autumn westerly winds were related with catch rates. Northerly winds in spring, upwelling and SST (winter and autumn) were related with catch rates in IXaS-Algarve. For species with a long spawning season such as horse mackerel, seasonal analyses at broad regional scales can detract from a better understanding of variability in short term sub-stock catch rates. Favorable environmental conditions, even during seasons with low spawning activity can positively affect catch rates.

  abstract = {Time-series models (Dynamic factorial analyses and; Min/max autocorrelation factor analysis) were used to explore the relative influences of environmental variables and fishing pressure of trawl, seine and artisanal fleets on catch rates on Trachurus trachurus in ICES IXa sub-divisions (IXaCN-North coast; IXaCS-South coast; IXaS-Algarve, South coast, Algarve). Fishing effort influenced catch rates in all areas with a 2 year lag and fishing pressure for each area was related to specific fleet sectors effort. In IXaCN, winter upwelling (spawning peak) and both summer northerly wind and wind magnitude (outside of the spawning peak) were strongly correlated with catch rates. In IXaCS summer/autumn westerly winds were related with catch rates. Northerly winds in spring, upwelling and SST (winter and autumn) were related with catch rates in IXaS-Algarve. For species with a long spawning season such as horse mackerel, seasonal analyses at broad regional scales can detract from a better understanding of variability in short term sub-stock catch rates. Favorable environmental conditions, even during seasons with low spawning activity can positively affect catch rates. Ignoring the role of regional oceanographic features on the spatial distribution of the sub-stocks when analysing variability in catch rates can lead to poor inferences about the productivity of the populations.},

  abstract = {Stylet increment analysis is a method of octopus age estimation that quantifies growth rings within stylets (reduced internal shells found in the mantle). This method was applied to wild Octopus pallidus to determine gender and seasonal influences on age and growth. A total of 503 individuals (94 males and 409 females) were aged, revealing that O. pallidus can reach a maximum age of approx\- imately 1.6 yr and that spawning occurs throughout the year. Male octopuses on average were signifi\- cantly larger (550 and 482 g for males and females, respectively) and older (259 and 243 d for males and females, respectively) than female, and overall growth rates were positively correlated with tempera\- ture at hatching. However, these differences were secondary to individual growth heterogeneity. Growth of males ranged from 1.32 to 5.33\% body weight (bw) d--1 and females from 1.55 to 6.9\% bw d--1, with no relationship between age and size evident regardless of sex. Stylet increment analysis is a promising technique that could play a role similar role to statoliths in squid as an ageing tool.},

  abstract = {Although chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) is a primary pelagic fish species, we have only limited knowledge on its key life history processes. The present work studied the age and growth of chub mackerel in the East China and Yellow Seas. Age was determined by interpreting and counting growth rings on the sagitta otoliths of 252 adult fish caught by the Chinese commercial purse seine fleet during the period from November 2006 to January 2007 and 150 juveniles from bottom trawl surveys on the spawning ground in May 2006. The difference between the assumed birth date of 1st April and date of capture was used to adjust the age determined from counting the number of complete translucent rings. The parameters of three commonly used growth models, the von Bertalanffy, Logistic and Gompertz models, were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the von Bertalanffy growth model was found to be the most appropriate model. The size-at-age and size-at-maturity values were also found to decrease greatly compared with the results achieved in the 1950s, which was caused by heavy exploitation over the last few decades.},

  abstract = {In the world, more than 80\% of the fisheries by numbers and about half of the catches have not been formally analyzed and evaluated due to limited data. It has led to the fast growth of data-poor evaluation methods. There have been various studies carried out on the comparative performance of data-poor and data-moderate methods in evaluating fishery exploitation status. However, most studies to date have focused on coastal fish stocks with simple data sources. It is important to pay attention to high sea fisheries because they are exploited by multiple countries, fishing gears and data may be divrsified and inconsistent. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of catch-based, length-based, and abundance-based methods to estimate fishery status is needed. This study is the first attempt to apply catch-based, length-based, and abundance-based data-poor methods to stock assessment for an oceanic tuna fishery and to compare the performance with a data-moderate model. Results showed that the three data-poor methods with various types of data did not produce an entirely consistent stock status of the southern Atlantic albacore (Thunnus alalunga) fishery in 2005, as the estimated B2005/BMSY ranged from 0.688 to 1.3 and F2005/FMSY ranged from 0.708 to 1.6. The Monte Carlo Catch maximum sustainable yield model (CMSY) produced a similar time series of B/BMSY and F/FMSY and stock status (recovering) to the Bayesian state-space Schaefer model (BSM). The abundance-based method (AMSY) gave the most conservative condition (overfished) of this fishery. Sensitivity analysis showed the results of the length-based Bayesian biomass estimation method (LBB) are sensitive to Linf settings, and the results with higher Linf were similar to those of other models. However, the LBB results with setting Linf at lower levels produced more optimistic conditions (healthy). Our results highlight that attention should be paid to the settings of model parameter priors and different trends implied in various types of data when using these data-poor methods.},

We present an extension to generalized depletion models to estimate the abundance and natural mortality rate of transit stock fishes using detailed fishery catch and effort data. We apply the model to 13 annual seasons of the Anguilla japonica glass eel fishery in the Shuang River estuary, northeast Taiwan. Estimates of abundance and natural mortality compare well with estimates for other species obtained from experimental studies or from data-rich stock assessment models at similar spatial scales. Parameter estimates are generally robust to biases and imprecision in the fisheries catch and effort data. The size of migration waves arriving at the estuary support a splitting mechanism controlled by eddies during oceanic migration. This extension of generalized depletion model provides a useful tool for the assessment of glass eel fisheries in East Asia, South East Asia, Europe and North America when only fisheries-dependent data are available.},

  abstract = {Feeding habits and habitat preferences of five related species (Aspitrigla cuculus, Chelidonichthys lucerna, Chelidonichthys obscurus, Eutrigla gurnardus and Trigla lyra) (Scorpaeniformes: Triglidae) were studied in the southern Bay of Biscay. Specimens were collected during annual bottom trawl surveys carried out every autumn between 1990 and 2008 on soft bottoms of the Galician and Cantabrian Sea continental shelf between 30 and 800 m depth. All species were found to display a different depth distribution, despite co-occurring in many of the hauls (co-occurrence percentage ranged between 4.45 and 34.77\%). Although depth was the main variable explaining the triglid distribution, latitude, temperature and sediment type were also important driving factors. Regarding feeding habits all triglids fed mainly on crustaceans, their main prey being Alpheus glaber, Polybius henslowii, Scyllarus arctus, Chlorotocus crassicornis and Pagurus prideaux. However, fish accounted for a considerable proportion of the diet with Gadiculus argenteus, Callionymus spp., and Cepola rubescens being the most common fish prey. Ontogenetic changes in diet were evident in all species but C. obscurus. Dietary overlap, determined by the Schoener Index greatly differed amongst species pairs ranging between 0.10 and 0.63.

  abstract = {Feeding habits and habitat preferences of five related species (Aspitrigla cuculus, Chelidonichthys lucerna, Chelidonichthys obscurus, Eutrigla gurnardus and Trigla lyra) (Scorpaeniformes: Triglidae) were studied in the southern Bay of Biscay. Specimens were collected during annual bottom trawl surveys carried out every autumn between 1990 and 2008 on soft bottoms of the Galician and Cantabrian Sea continental shelf between 30 and 800 m depth. All species were found to display a different depth distribution, despite co-occurring in many of the hauls (co-occurrence percentage ranged between 4.45 and 34.77\%). Although depth was the main variable explaining the triglid distribution, latitude, temperature and sediment type were also important driving factors. Regarding feeding habits all triglids fed mainly on crustaceans, their main prey being Alpheus glaber, Polybius henslowii, Scyllarus arctus, Chlorotocus crassicornis and Pagurus prideaux. However, fish accounted for a considerable proportion of the diet with Gadiculus argenteus, Callionymus spp., and Cepola rubescens being the most common fish prey. Ontogenetic changes in diet were evident in all species but C. obscurus. Dietary overlap, determined by the Schoener Index greatly differed amongst species pairs ranging between 0.10 and 0.63. Considering all ontogenetic groups in the triglid assemblage, either diet or habitat segregation occurred between most of them. This fact suggests that any of these strategies on their own would suffice in order to avoid inter and intra specific competitions.

  abstract = {Fisheries stock assessments increasingly account for size-dependence in natural mortality rates, usually by modeling mortality as a power function of body length. Various empirical studies have indicated a scaling of mortality with length in the range of - 0.84 to - 1.11, but substantially different scaling exponents ranging from - 0.75 to - 1.5 have been proposed on theoretical grounds or derived from some empirical models. To resolve these controversies and provide a well-supported default estimate of scaling for stock assessments, we reanalyzed two major data sets used in previous studies that supported different scaling exponents, and a com\- bined data set. Both original data sets and the combined data yielded within-population exponents close to - 1 when analyzed using joint-slope mixed-effects models with population as a random effect. When population effects were disregarded, regression models yielded exponents that did not correctly reflect within-population scaling. The greatest deviations from the correct within-population scaling of approximately - 1 occurred in multiple regression models of mortality, size, and growth parameters. We conclude that within- and amongpopulation scaling of natural mortality should be clearly distinguished, and that within-population scaling of natural mortality with length in fish populations is highly consistent at approximately - 1. We also explored empirical models for predicting the intercept of the mortality-length relationship for a given population from growth parameters.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality rates (M) in fish populations vary with body size and age, often by orders of magnitude over the life cycle. Traditionally, fisheries models and stock assessment methods have treated M as constant in the recruited stock, but that axiom has been challenged on empirical and theoretical grounds, and by practical assessment needs. Reviewing biological considerations, empirical generalizations, and theoretical models of sizeand age-dependent natural mortality in fish populations, I show how multiple strands of evidence lead to a coherent new M paradigm best described as `generalized length-inverse mortality' (GLIM). GLIM holds that mortality declines inversely with body length throughout much of the juvenile and adult phases of the fish lifecycle. Deviations from the length-inverse pattern may occur in older ages due to senescence and in early juveniles due to density-dependence. GLIM is strongly supported by empirical meta-analyses of mortality-size relationships and is also broadly consistent with multi-species and ecosystem models of predation mortality. Whether operationalized in closed functional form or through multi-species modeling of predation and residual mortality, GLIM provides a new `standard M{$\prime$} for fish population modeling and stock assessment applications. Consequences of mis-specifying size- and age-dependent M in stock assessment applications vary from moderate in many cases to severe under certain conditions, but even moderate consequences can be quantitatively sig\- nificant in stock assessment and management. Further research is indicated with regards to senescence and to the representation of residual or non-predation mortality (M1) in multi-species and ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {Octopus vulgaris is commercially caught in Portugal both as a target species and as a by-catch of a diverse collection of fisheries and me{\textasciiacute}tiers. The successful assessment and management of the resource largely depends on the quality of the fisheries or research data. To date no satisfactory measure of effort was possible for the artisanal fisheries, the greatest source of landings data. Based on the analysis of data on daily landings per vessel collected by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Fisheries from sales within official landing and auction sites, an abundance index in kg day-1 standard vessel-1 is proposed as an alternative to the more customary indices, which are not always available or comparable. This methodology constitutes an improvement to an LPUE index based simply on the landings and number of vessels in operation and appears to be sufficiently robust to be used independently of me{\textasciiacute}tier. Data on 18 months of daily landings of O. vulgaris are used as a case study. The new abundance estimates display time-shifts, changes in importance of peaks and generally lower abundance, in relation to estimates from landings and landings per vessel. The lower abundance estimates, suggest a precautionary approach attitude.},

However, existing statistical stock assessment models can have low forecast performance of relevant stock parameters like recruitment or spawning stock biomass, especially in ecosystems that are changing due to global warming and other anthropogenic stressors. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning models to improve the estimation and forecast of such stock parameters. We propose a hybrid model that combines classical statistical stock assessment models with supervised ML, specifically gradient boosted trees. Our hybrid model leverages the initial estimate provided by the classical model and uses the ML model to make a post-hoc correction to improve accuracy. We experiment with five different stocks and find that the forecast accuracy of recruitment and spawning stock biomass improves considerably in most cases.},

Population dynamics of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica vary spatially within the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, and our objective was to better char\- acterize oyster population dynamics by estimating changes in natural mortality, fishing mortality, abundance, and recruitment over time and space. We developed statistical stage-structured models for 36 regions and fit the models to fishery dependent and independent data sources. Regional patterns in population dynamics emerged that would have been lost in a spatially aggregated approach. Regions that were closer together tended to have similar patterns in natural mortality, exploitation rates, abundance, and recruitment over time. We were able to estimate time-varying natural mortality because ancillary data on the number of dead individuals were incor\- porated into the population dynamics model. This approach to estimating time-varying natural mortality may be more widely applicable to species where dead individuals are observed in routine surveys.},

In acoustic evaluations conducted along the Moroccan coast since 1995, the absence of juveniles in 1996 and 1998 and the collapse of the sardine stock between 1996 and 1997 represent the main events until 2002. Sardines are known to be microphageous planktivores and thus are sensitive to environmental variability. A biogeochemical model coupled to a hydrodynamic model (ROMS) was run over the Canary Current System (1991--2002) to investigate the environmental factors that could have played a role in the variability of the sardine spawning. A grid refinement (1/12{$^\circ$}) centred on the Saharan Bank (SB) region was built to study the main spawning ground of sardines off northwest Africa. The volume of the potential spawning habitat (PSH) of sardines was defined as a function of depth, temperature and salinity, which are included in the ranges 0--200{$\quad$}m, 15--21{$^\circ$}C and 35.8--36.8, respectively. Our modelling frame was able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of temperature, phytoplankton concentration and PSH over the SB. It also captured the warming associated with the negative index of the North Atlantic Oscillation of 1995--1997 and allowed a description of the inter-annual variability of the PSH. Our experiment shows that the volume of PSH was much reduced in 1996 compared to the other years. The results suggest that the delay between high abundance of plankton and favourable spawning conditions is a good proxy for determining the recruitment failure of sardine in this oceanic region.},

Eleven taxa are new host records, and one is probably a new species. The geographical distribution and biology of each parasite and its value for the stock identification of T. trachurus are described and discussed. The most effective biological tags were the larval nematodes Anisakis spp. and Hysterothylacium aduncum. The distinctive pattern of infection with these nematodes observed in samples from the single North Sea station clearly distinguishes this from all other stations and supports the current management strategy which treats the North Sea population as a separate stock. The distinction between the putative ``western'', ``southern'' and ``mauritanian'' stocks is less clear, with evidence of considerable mixing between them. The highly localised distributions of some parasites in the Mediterranean part of the study area suggest that T. trachurus populations there appear to comprise three main stocks---western, central and eastern. There is also strong evidence of the migration of fish from Atlantic populations into the extreme western part of the Mediterranean.},

Changes in the fleet's fishing power are differentiated from variations in population abundance through the use of an abundance index estimated from the CPUE of an index vessel catching the species as by-catch. Observed inter-vessel differences in efficiency are then explained by vessel characteristics such as gear used, engine power, length of headline and ground rope, availability of GPS and skipper skills. The application of the method to the French bottom-trawlers targeting anglerfish in the Bay of Biscay and in the Celtic Sea during the period 1983--1998 reveals that fishing gear (twin or simple trawls) and engine power are the most important variables for explaining differences in fishing power.

The system that we propose uses 3D motion information obtained with a 3D scanner to detect the presence of new fish boxes in conveyor belts or planar scales. Once a new box is identified, RGB and depth images are acquired, processed, and uploaded to a remote database. Experimental results that validate and illustrate the performance of the proposed system are presented, as well as a comparison with the current approach to estimate landings length composition by trip and species.},

Data Envelopment Analysis was implemented to estimate and assess capacity utilization and efficiency for the first time in the eastern Mediterranean. The purse-seine fleet segments were found to operate below their capacity output level indicating the existence of overcapacity. The 24--40 m segment was evidenced to be more efficient than the 12--24 m fleet segment. Results suggested that purse-seiners could have increased their output by 89\% (12--24 m) and 48\% (24--40 m) providing current stock status and unrestricted access to resources. Fishing vessels may potentially improve their earnings by approximately 20\% by increasing variable inputs. In data poor environments, such as the Mediterranean Sea, the simple DEA models applied in this study provide a useful approach to capacity and efficiency assessment. The quantitative measures of excess and overcapacity obtained, may contribute valuable information in balancing the productive capacity of the stock with the harvesting capacity of the fleet.},

Data were collected during a 2-year period (1996--1997) of quasi-synoptic sampling using demersal trawl surveys in the northern Aegean Sea. The results of this study supported these hypotheses. It was found that geographic position and sea bottom characteristics influence the temporal distribution patterns of red mullet and hake. Data are presented that reveal species-specific aggregation patterns and an important habitat utilisation of the area. The modelled species' abundances showed a strongly non-linear dependence on the explanatory covariates. This study, although not directly dealing with spawning, also provided evidence that red mullet and hake demonstrate environmental and bathymetric preferences in the months posterior to spawning. Mean red mullet abundance was consistently highest in areas with warmer bottom waters in the east and west than in the centre, these areas having shallower depths (35--60 m) and bottom temperatures around 19{$^\circ$}C. The red mullet appeared to avoid the cold bottom waters ({$<$}16{$^\circ$}C) of the deeper regions. Results indicated that areas with the highest hake abundances were located in waters of {$\sim$}160 m having bottom temperature of {$\sim$}16{$^\circ$}C and avoided the shallower waters ({$<$}70 m) regardless of their bottom temperature. The present findings also suggested that colder bottom waters at all depths were associated with lower-than-average hake abundance. Red mullet and hake preferences for areas with specific bathymetric and ocean environmental conditions are believed to be linked to the oceanography of the NE Mediterranean ecosystem.},

Short-term fisher tactics employed on trip by trip basis can change significantly due to their targeting behaviour, which in turn can lead to changes in catch composition and production output. A stochastic distance function was used to examine a Mediterranean pelagic fleet's technical efficiency and fishers' ability to modulate their targeting behaviour. The purse seine fleet operated under increasing returns to scale, suggesting that the larger vessels could potentially amplify their short-term profitability by increasing the levels of inputs and harvests. Production was mainly joint, yet the possibility for limited substitution between species existed. The observed fishers' targeting behaviour was dissimilar between fleet segments due to differences in fishing effort and vessel characteristics, with larger vessels able to modify their revenue more than smaller ones. The estimated differences between the two fleet segments could be important in designing effective management regimes aimed at reducing resource overexploitation through individual input controls.},

  abstract = {Fishers have a considerable knowledge about how fish stocks behave; knowledge that is difficult to acquire in other ways. Short-term fisher tactics employed on trip by trip basis can change significantly due to their targeting behaviour, which in turn can lead to changes in catch composition and production output. A stochastic distance function was used to examine a Mediterranean pelagic fleet's technical efficiency and fishers' ability to modulate their targeting behaviour. The purse seine fleet operated under increasing returns to scale, suggesting that the larger vessels could potentially amplify their short-term profitability by increasing the levels of inputs and harvests. Production was mainly joint, yet the possibility for limited substitution between species existed. The observed fishers' targeting behaviour was dissimilar between fleet segments due to differences in fishing effort and vessel characteristics, with larger vessels able to modify their revenue more than smaller ones. The estimated differences between the two fleet segments could be important in designing effective management regimes aimed at reducing resource overexploitation through individual input controls.},

  abstract = {The purse-seine fishery for anchovy in the Aegean Sea consists of two main fleet segments (12 --24 and 24-- 40 m vessels); this paper investigates economically and biologically preferable effort and capacity scenarios for the fishery. Attention is paid to a bioeconomic analysis of fleets composed of segments with varying levels of efficiency (in terms of catch rate) and costs (fixed and variable) and the role this might play in optimal effort allocation at a fleet level. An age-structured stochastic bioeconomic operating model for Aegean anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is constructed. It attempts to account robustly for the multiple uncertainties in the system, including (i) the effort -- fishing mortality relationship, (ii) the selectivity, and (iii) the stock-- recruit dynamics of the population. A method is proposed for determining the economically optimal level of long-term effort in a fishery such as this, with similar characteristics in terms of stock dynamics, fishery, and markets. Lower values of effort and capacity are predicted to yield greater future profit when viewing the fleet in its entirety, but even lower values may be advisable to maintain the long-term biological integrity of the stock. The results may prove useful in balancing the productivity of the stock with the harvesting capacity of the fleet, while managing to ensure the long-term profitability of the fleet along with the sustainability of the resource.},

  abstract = {The striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, is one of the most abundant cetacean species off the Western Iberian coast, however, studies on the species regarding biology, ecology, threats or conservation efforts are lacking. This study investigates stranding patterns (years 1981--2014) and diet (2002--2014) of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) off the Portuguese mainland coast. Stranded animals were sampled along the whole coast (n = 252). Most stranded striped dolphins were recorded in the first half of the year and strandings increased over time. Analysis of stomach contents (n = 36) showed that striped dolphins in the area are mostly piscivorous (80\% by number and weight of the diet), taking pelagic, meso-pelagic and demersal species. In terms of reconstructed biomass prey, sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) were the most important. Prey items revealed that both sexes forage at a range of depths (pelagic and demersal systems) in both neritic and oceanic habitats, although females feed more often in coastal waters. Moreover, diet results also indicate that striped dolphins may co-occur with other neritic cetacean species, such as the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, thus sharing some preferred prey species. The study revealed that striped dolphins on the Iberian coast interact with coastal fisheries sharing the same target species. Management measures for fisheries will need to be consistent with an ecosystem-based approach.},

Snipefish (8-17 cm) were regularly found off Portugal, occasionally in large concentrations, but were absent from the Gulf of Cadiz. Off northern Portugal, snipefish were distributed along the outer shelf and upper slope, clearly separated from sardine (the most abundant species in the inner shelf) and partially overlapping with blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), the most abundant species in the upper slope. Snipefish were most abundant in the outer shelf of south-western Portugal, preferentially distributed in large aggregations around the Canyon of Setubal and partially overlapping with the distribution of boarfish (Capros aper) and blue whiting (both abundant in the upper slope of south-western Portugal). Off southern Portugal snipefish were almost exclusively distributed in the outer shelf and were significantly smaller than in south-western (intermediate) and northern Portugal (large). Acoustic estimates of total snipefish biomass ranged between 176 -- 504 thousand tonnes within the study period, with more than half off south-western Portugal. Within the period 1998-2003, and despite the lack of directed fishing activity, a marked decline in abundance and a small but significant increase in mean length were observed, particularly off south-western Portugal.},

  abstract = {Juveniles of carangid fishes including jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus are known to associate with jellyfishes. The function of this association behavior was studied through rearing experiments and underwater visual observations. Association behavior of jack mackerel with moon jellyfish in experimental tanks was more frequent in the presence compared to the absence of predators (chub mackerel Scomber japonicus). In the experimental tanks, the presence of jellyfish, however, did not mitigate predation by these predators. Although jack mackerel did not feed on the jellyfish itself, they frequently fed on the captured prey (Artemia nauplii) whilst in the gut cavity of the jellyfish. Underwater observations of giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai off Kyoto and Fukui prefectures revealed that approximately 30\% of these jellyfish were accompanied by jack mackerel juveniles with body sizes ranging 10--45 mm standard length (SL). Considering that jack mackerel juveniles found in subtidal rocky reefs ranged 40--120 mm SL, we considered that jack mackerel from 10 to 45 mm SL associate with jellyfish as a hiding place as well as a food collector, until they find a suitable reef habitat when they attain approximately 40 mm SL.},

Although escape performance from jellyfish was not different between the larvae of jack mackerel and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, both species showed better survival compared to red sea bream Pagrus major larvae of a similar size. Although jack mackerel were slow in growth, their slow cruise swimming may reduce the chance of encountering predators and fast burst swimming may help escape from gelatinous predators.},

The purse seine net fishery exploits young and adult fish during the foraging season, while the dip net fishery exploits fish before and during the spawning season. To compare the damage to the chub mackerel stock caused by purse seine net and dip net fisheries, we introduced impact factors of the two kinds of fisheries on the population. We used data on the number of chub mackerel born in 1982 caught in each year by the two kinds of fisheries and estimated number of eggs spawned in 1982. We defined the impact factor as the ratio of the average reproductive value of individuals caught by each fishery to the reproductive value at maturity. The number of individuals caught by the purse seine net fishery was 66 times larger than the number caught by the dip net fishery, while the impact factor of the former was 84\% of that of the latter. Thus, the total damage caused by the purse seine net fishery was much higher than the damage caused by the dip net fishery. We can evaluate the damage caused by mortality factors on endangered species using this method.},

The purse-seine fishery consistently had a larger impact on the population than did the dip-net fishery, mainly because the catch by the former was much larger than that by the latter. To evaluate impact per unit weight in catch, we calculated the average reproductive value per unit weight over individuals caught by each fishery as an indicator of efficient use of bioresource. Because the proportion of immature fish caught by the purse-seine fishery was usually larger than that by the dip-net fishery, the impact per unit weight in catch by the purse-seine fishery was not always less than that by the dip-net fishery.},

Genetic markers applied to 2200 Anisakis larvae, allowed the detection of Anisakis simplex (s.s.), Anisakis pegreffii, Anisakis physeteris, Anisakis typica and Anisakis sp., in 20 horse mackerel samples. The two most dominant species were A. pegreffii and A. simplex (s.s.), with statistically significant differences between samples. A. simplex (s.s.) was the most common species found in all samples from NE Atlantic waters, with its relative proportion decreasing from north (south coast of Norway) to south (Portuguese coast off Algarve). In contrast, A. pegreffii was the most prevalent species in the Mediterranean Sea. Mixed infections of A. simplex (s.s.) and A. pegreffii were found in all samples from the Portuguese and Spanish Atlantic coasts and in a sample from south of Ireland. Finally, in horse mackerel caught off Ma{\textasciiacute}laga (Mediterranean Sea), mixed infections of the same two species were found in almost equal proportions. Anisakis physeteris occurred rarely and in mixed infections with A. pegreffii in a sample from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Similarly, A. typica was rarely found in mixed infections with A. pegreffii in the eastern Mediterranean (Aegean Sea), as well as the Anisakis sp. with A. simplex (s.s.) in the North Sea samples. The biogeographical pattern of Anisakis spp. larvae indicates the presence of distinct Mediterranean and Atlantic stocks of horse mackerel and supports the existence of a ``northern'' stock separated from a ``southern'' one in the Atlantic region. The results also highlight the vagility of horse mackerel, supporting the hypothesis of some migration from the Atlantic into the extreme Western Mediterranean Sea.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is one of the most influential parameters in fisheries stock assessment and management. It relates directly to stock productivity and reference points used for fisheries management advice. Unfortunately, M is also very difficult to estimate, and hence very uncertain. Representing the uncertainty in M and how this influences estimates of management quantities is therefore an important component of conducting stock as\- sessments. This paper outlines the range of methods available to estimate M for use in stock assessment. The methods include those based on maximum age, life history theory, relationships between ``well-known'' values for M (those found in the literature and based on data for the stock being assessed) and covariates, use of tagging data and catch curve analysis, and estimation within a single- or multi-species stock assessment model. All methods are likely subject to bias and imprecision due to incorrect assumptions and incomplete data. Further\- more, M is generally assumed to be constant over time, age, and sex - assumptions that are unlikely to be true for any stock. Based on our review, there is an obvious benefit to directly estimating M using data and within a stock assessment while assigning a prior based on empirical methods. This approach effectively uses all the available information while also representing the uncertainty. Carefully examining diagnostics and checking for model misspecification is required to ensure that the available data and stock assessment model assumptions are appropriately informative about M when it is estimated during the model fitting process. For situations where direct estimation is not possible (a condition found in data-limited to data-rich stock assessments), the use of multiple methods with robust sensitivity exploration is recommended. Even when direct data are integrated into a stock assessment, we recommend using other methods to estimate M and analysing the direct data outside the stock assessment model as diagnostic tools.},

  abstract = {When viewed on a discrete time step (e.g., one year) rather than instantaneously, the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationships describe a strong influence of changes in adult abundance on juvenile survival even at low biomass levels. In fact, they describe a stronger influence at lower adult abundance than at high adult abundance. This is not consistent with a simplistic interpretation of carrying capacity, where survival reduces more rapidly as the juvenile abundance approaches its carrying capacity due to resource limitation. It implies that other processes (e.g., changes in predation risk with increased abundance as described by arena theory) control density dependence. A simple habitat limitation model suggests that a similar relationship can occur if the number of juveniles produced by the adults is always more than the juvenile carrying capacity. However, the resulting stock-recruitment relationship is constant recruitment, while that of the Beverton-Holt is increasing asymptotically and the Ricker is dome shaped. Fluctuations around an average recruitment level for a wide range of adult abundance levels is common for highly fecund pelagic spawners (e.g., tuna), suggesting that the survival and recruitment relationships implied by the simple habitat limitation model might be appropriate for these species. Underpinning this argument is the concept that the adult population will saturate the juvenile carrying capacity unless the adult population is fished to extremely low levels. However, it is reasonable to expect that survival should be density independent, or possibly even decompensatory, at some low level of adult abundance. Ignoring depensation, the survival relationship would therefore be well described by a general logistic equation where the decline in survival initially accelerates as abundance increases and then deaccelerates. The resulting stock-recruitment relationship would be a hockey stick shape with the possibility of reduced recruitment at large stock sizes. The model could also be used for low fecund species (e.g., sharks) for which the juvenile carrying capacity is not saturated until the adult abundance is large (i.e., survival is density-independent for a wide range of adult population sizes). In our model, particularly for high fecund species, temporal variation in recruitment would be controlled by changes in the juvenile carrying capacity. We provide equations for the generalized logistic survival stock-recruitment model and investigate the yield consequences. We suggest that an important management consideration is the level of adult abundance at which the juvenile carrying capacity becomes saturated (i.e., when does density dependence become influential on juvenile survival).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Scientific bottom-trawl surveys are ecological observation programs conducted along continental shelves and slopes of seas and oceans that sample marine communities associated with the seafloor. These surveys report taxa occurrence, abundance and/or weight in space and time, and contribute to fisheries management as well as population and biodiversity research. Bottom-trawl surveys are conducted all over the world and represent a unique opportunity to understand ocean biogeography, macroecology, and global change. However, combining these data together for cross-ecosystem analyses remains challenging. Here, we present an integrated dataset of 29 publicly available bottom-trawl surveys conducted in national waters of 18 countries that are standardized and pre-processed, covering a total of 2,170 sampled fish taxa and 216,548 hauls collected from 1963 to 2021. We describe the processing steps to create the dataset, flags, and standardization methods that we developed to assist users in conducting spatio-temporal analyses with stable regional survey footprints. The aim of this dataset is to support research, marine conservation, and management in the context of global change.},

  abstract = {A generalized Bayesian surplus production stock assessment software (BSP2) is presented as an update to ICCAT's current BSP software. BSP2 differs from BSP in a few different respects. Most importantly, BSP2 provides a state-space implementation of the deterministic Bayesian generalized surplus production model found in BSP. BSP2 models both process error in the dynamics equations to account for the effects of, e.g., interannual variation in recruitment, and error in predicted observations. BPS2 provides outputs to enable the computation of Bayes factors (BFs). BFs show Bayes posterior weights for different models and can be particularly important when structurally different models suggest different interpretations of stock status. A generalized production function implementation (i.e., the Fletcher model) is incorporated in which the ratio of the most productive stock size to carrying capacity can be set at hypothesized values other than the Schaefer model value of 0.5. The software can accommodate a variety of different priors for key parameters including carrying capacity (K), the maximum rate of population increase (r), and the ratio of stock biomass in the initial year to carrying capacity (Binit/K).},

  abstract = {Many tropical reef fisheries are underperforming relative to maximum sustained yields despite their importance for the economies and food security of natural resource dependent people. Assessments of fisheries in tropical reefs have been hampered by the logistic difficulty and costs of making empirical estimates of sustainable yields in multi-species fisheries. To overcome this limitation, we used empirical fish biomass recovery data in high-compliance closures to create a production curve estimate that established biomass and yields at maximum sustained yield (Bmsy). A multivariate machine learning model using environmental and human influence proxies made biomass and yield estimates in 10,815 {$\sim$}6.25~km2 Indian Ocean cells. Subsequent analyses determined the national over- and under-fishing status. Identified proxies of travel time from markets, depth, and fisheries management were the main drivers of biomass and subsequent status. The East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique had 18,500~km2 of reef and the lowest regional estimated biomass - losing 17,600 tons of commercial target fish per year. Therefore, the estimated loss is between US\$ 50--150~million per year depending on the worth in the fisheries trade's value chain The more populated islands of Reunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Comoros have smaller areas (5000~km2) and losing 3000 tons/year, and {$>$}US\$ 9 million per year. Madagascar has many reefs (13,700~km2) and larger variation in yields with an estimated loss of {$\sim$}6000 tons/y. Increased restrictions could greatly increase the value of Indian Ocean fisheries by promoting the recovery of target biomass and recovering lost income.},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses."--},

  abstract = {The development of the relationship between otolith and body size in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) between hatching and emergence was examined by repeatedly measuring individually identified fish. Otolith growth increments were deposited daily in the period between hatching and emergence. Comparison of back-calculated otolith size and standard length using least squares regression analyses revealed a weak relationship between these variables at each of the 5-day sampling intervals. However, when data sets were pooled among intervals, variation in otolith size accounted for 98\% of the variation in alevin length. A computer simulation demonstrated that levels of measurement error similar to those documented in our study resulted in the failure of regression analyses to detect strong relationships between otolith and fish size. Mortality that occurred during the experiment was strongly size selective. This truncated the size ranges of fish in cross-sectional data sets and thus reduced the ability of regression analysis to detect relationships between otolith and fish size. We propose that the weak relationship between otolith and fish size at emergence recorded in previous studies was an artifact of measurement error and the truncation of size ranges in regression analyses. Differences in alevin size at emergence were present at hatching and had been propagated by growth.},

They have been used traditionally to obtain information about the taxon, age and size of fishes. This is very important because age, growth rate, and mortality rate are three of the most influential life history characteristics controlling the productivity of fish populations. Besides age and growth determination, otoliths have been the object of study in many different fields, such as fish biology (hearing and balance in fishes), larval fish ecology, species identification, fish stock identification and environmental reconstruction of the fish habitat. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the traditional and current applications of the otoliths. Also, a short description of the traditional methods for age determination is included.},

We illustrate our explanation with a non-published case of study as well as leaning on another example already published by the authors, although very different kinds of study can be treated with these meth-ods. The application process is made up of three main stages. The result of a first data pre-processing phase is the training data set. The second stage involves the ap-plication of one or several induction algorithms, which translates into a set of trees. The analysis and interpretation of these trees, in the third and last stage, allows the generation of new knowledge about the system analyzed.},

  abstract = {The multi-component aspect of species diversity of groundfish assemblages was examined on the basis of a set of experimental trawl surveys conducted on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Lions. The structure of species diversity was investigated through the simultaneous analysis of indices relating to 4 diversity components: (1) the number of species (species density S and Margalef's Dmg index), (2) rarity (number of species with less than 5\% of occurrence), (3) evenness (Heip's EHeip and BergereParker's 1/d indices) and (4) taxonomic diversity (D, D*, D{\th}, L{\th}). In addition, two popular heterogeneous indices (Simpson's 1 {\`A} D and Shannon's H' indices) combining the number of species and evenness were also considered. PCA based on Spearman's correlation coefficients was carried out to investigate empirical relationships between these 11 indices while generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyse diversity patterns in relation to bathymetry. Our results showed that the 11 species diversity indices studied might be grouped into 6 complementary components: (1) number of species (species density S and Margalef's Dmg index), (2) evenness (EHeip, 1/d, H0, 1 {\`A} D, D), (3) rarity and each of the 3 other measures of taxonomy: (4) D*, (5) D{\th}, and (6) L{\th}. This result showed not only that a single diversity index cannot provide a complete description of species diversity but also that e in some cases e it cannot even encapsulate a complete description of a specific diversity component. In addition, in contrast to their expected theoretical properties, some descriptors appeared to be redundant in our field study. Finally, we found that the influence of depth on diversity patterns is usually significant but weak and varies according to the diversity components considered. Our findings e which show that diversity descriptors may respond in different ways to habitat degradation or loss e highlight the complexity of defining priority areas of protection taking simultaneously into account the main characteristics of diversity.},

The sampling operations are made at predefined geographical locations, the fishing stations, within predefined multiple time windows. The vessel route starts and ends at the port of Lisbon and must visit all fishing stations. According to a predefined periodicity, the vessel must enter a port to supply food, refuel and/or change crew. Given the geographical locations of the fishing stations/ports and the current weather conditions, the objective is to minimize the total traveled distance and the completion time. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Program to describe the problem and propose two sequential heuristic approaches, that combine genetic algorithms and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search, to solve it. Computational experience with real data shows that the proposed heuristics are suitable tools to solve the problem.},

A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.},

  abstract = {Gear technology for the ef{\textregistered}cient size selection of mackerel and saithe in purse seines has been developed. A critical constraint for application of the technology is the survival of the {\textregistered}sh that escape. We have conducted a series of small scale experiments in which penned mackerel and saithe have been forced through rigid grids into new storage pens in order to quantify their survival rates. Both species suffered insigni{\textregistered}cant mortality. We have also conducted full scale experiments during purse seining for mackerel off western Norway, and during purse seining for saithe in fjords in western and northern Norway. Control groups were established by transferring parts of the catch gently from the purse seine to attached net pens. Experimental groups were established by collecting the {\textregistered}sh that escaped through the selection grids in attached net pens. The net pens were subsequently towed for up to 30 nautical miles before they were anchored inshore. In the mackerel experiments, maximum 95\% of the control groups and maximum 60\% of the experimental groups survived 1 month after the experiments. This indicates that the size selection process in mackerel purse seining may cause too high a mortality rate to allow it to be recommended for commercial {\textregistered}shing. On the other hand, the mortality in the saithe experiments was insigni{\textregistered}cant, and the use of size selection grids in saithe purse seines can therefore be recommended. \# 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A control sample of fish (\$500 individuals) was collected from the loosely bunted pocket of a purse seine net using a watertight, plastic-lined brail net and transferred into a 1000-l holding tank onboard a commercial fishing vessel. A commercial quantity of fish was then removed from the purse seine net and transferred into bins on deck. A small quantity of Sardinops (\$500 individuals) was retained in the net and the process of tightly bunting the net (aggregating the fish at high densities) and rolling excess fish over the headline of the purse seine net was simulated; these fish were similarly transferred to an onboard tank. Mortality rates of Sardinops were monitored over a 3--4-day period in a partitioned ocean cage. Significant differences in mortality between the control and the treatment groups were observed for all experiments. Mortality of Sardinops transported before the net was tightly bunted (i.e. control) and held in the floating cage ranged between 8 and 20\%, which were significantly lower than the mortality observed for the treatment group (11--55\%). Based on our results, we recommend that purse seine fisheries incorporate a net design which allows quick release of any unwanted catch. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Fish age estimation plays a crucial role in stock management and provides valuable information for biological studies. Fish age is typically estimated by experts that manually count annual increments in otoliths. This process is prone to age reader bias, which makes comparisons between readers and labs challenging, and requires considerable time and resources. In this study, we developed a machine learning framework for fish age pre\- diction using 5150 images of otoliths from Barents Sea Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) collected between 2012 and 2018. In contrast to previous studies that utilise models trained on otolith sections, we used images of broken otoliths that require no processing prior to imaging, and hence, could potentially facilitate at-sea age estimation. We trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on two modern architectures (EfficientNetV1 and EfficientNetV2), which vary in model size (number of model parameters), and compared performance. Model average accuracy was 72.7\% and mean-squared-error was 0.284 when compared with the human-read ages. The models' accuracy for one- and two-year-old individuals was over 90\% and no systematic bias in the age pre\- dictions across age groups was detected. The best models were EfficientNet B4 and EfficientNet B6 using images taken with low exposure times. A maximum accuracy of 78.6\% was achieved using an ensemble consisting of six models. Model predictions were also strongly correlated, limiting the utility of building large ensembles Model performance was compared to the results of an internal workshop where 100 independent images of broken otoliths were aged by a group of experts. Variations in percentage agreement between age classes showed a similar pattern (decreasing with age) in both CNN-based predictions and age estimates made by the expert group. While CNN-based percentage agreement was often lower than the expert estimates, it remained within or close to the range of percentage agreement observed across all readers. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques for extracting age estimates from otolith images. When developing frameworks for age estimation using machine learning, we recommend EfficientNet B4 models are used as they are quicker to train than larger models and perform well. Ensemble approaches are also recommended if sufficient computational resources are available, as they can provide increased accuracy and lower variance of the predictions.},

  abstract = {The goose barnacle, Pollicipes pollicipes, is an intertidal cirripede that lives attached to rocks on very exposed shores, forming dense aggregations. It occurs in the northeast Atlantic (from 48 to 14{\textopenbullet}N). Commercial fisheries have been developed in several countries, but except for a short-lived local consumption, most of the production is traded in the Spanish market, where the price can reach ?80/kg in first-sale auctions. This species shows a strong spatial structure, constituting metapopulations with local adult populations sharing a common larval pool. Advection of larvae depends largely of oceanographic conditions that govern larval transport and survival. In Galicia (NW Spain), the regional government regulations promote a co-management system between fishers' organisations (``cofrad{\textasciiacute}{\i}as'') and the fisheries authority through territorial user rights for fishing (TURFs). Since 1992, the exploitation is granted to ``cofrad{\textasciiacute}{\i}as'' after presentation of an annual plan of exploitation and management, where fishing (daily allocation of effort, maximum individual quotas and area of exploitation), surveillance and the commercialisation processes are established. The recent implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) designed for the management of Pollicipes in Galicia will allow for new ways to improve the elaboration and control of management plans by fishers' organisations using a combination of the available statistical data and computer-based methods. The system, including databases and software for the visualisation of geographic information, was designed for independent use in each ``cofrad{\textasciiacute}{\i}a'' or in a network, and its results are accessible in a web site (http://sigremar.cesga.es).},

  abstract = {Many capture fisheries worldwide have declined sharply in recent decades or have already collapsed from overfishing, and major fishing grounds are concentrated in zones threatened by pollution, habitat, and coastal zone modification. In Portugal, the European pilchard or sardine (Sardina pilchardus), which is mainly captured by purse seiners (>>98\%), is among the species most consumed (along with dried and salted cod), and commercially, it is the most important fish landed in national ports. Besides its consumption as fresh, canned sardine stands out among Portuguese seafood major exports. Although sardine has neither total allowable catch (TAC) nor quota, the Portuguese catch limits for sardine are regulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) at the request of the European Union (EU). Therefore, in practice, the ICES advice works as a theoretical TAC. The aim of this article is to diagnose the current state of sardine stocks in the areas where the Portuguese seine fishing is exerted and simultaneously assess if the structural changes induced on the purse seining fleet capacity, in response to the management system currently in force for this fishery, are aligned with its sustainable development. Our major findings conclude that sardine stocks are still exploited at levels that jeopardize the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Once the unavoidable restructuring of the Portuguese purse seine fleet will inevitably increase unemployment among fishers, we also stress the need to reshape the current CommunityLed Local Development (CLLD) program, funded under the EU fisheries structural aid, to make it more effective in minimizing the severe social impacts potentially coming out.},

Goals of the review were to evaluate the state of knowledge of bycatch and the role of existing protective legislation in shaping bycatch management for different taxa. Pressing issues are identified, as well as knowledge gaps and policy limitations that hinder multi-species bycatch reduction. The USA has made important progress toward reducing bycatch in its fisheries, but the efficacy of its management has been limited somewhat by a focus on taxon- and fishery-specific regulation and the lack of consistent mandate across taxa for taking a cumulative perspective on bycatch. Applying consistent criteria across taxa for setting bycatch limits (e.g., extending the approach used for marine mammals to sea turtles and seabirds) would be the first step in a multi-species approach to bycatch reduction. A population-based multispecies multi-gear approach to bycatch would help identify priority areas where resources are needed most and can be used most effectively.},

Although the original model was developed for geostatistics, it founds applications in other types of data, such as point processes in the form of presence-only data. While this has been recognized in the Statistics literature, there is value in incorporating ideas from both presence-only and preferential sampling literature. In this paper, we propose a novel model that extends existing ideas to handle a continuous variable collected through opportunistic sampling. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we apply it to sardine biomass data collected during commercial fishing trips. While the data is intuitively understood, it poses challenges due to two types of preferential sampling: fishing events (presence data) are non-random samples of the region, and fishermen tend to set their nets in areas with a high quality and value of catch (i.e., bigger schools of the target species). We discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the problem, and propose a well-defined probabilistic approach. Our approach employs a data augmentation scheme that predicts the number of unobserved fishing locations and corresponding biomass (in kg). This allows for evaluation of the Poisson Process likelihood without the need for numerical approximations. The results of our case study may serve as an incentive to use data collected during commercial fishing trips for decision-making aimed at benefiting both ecological and economic aspects. The proposed methodology has potential applications in a variety of fields, including ecology and epidemiology, where marked point process model are commonly used.},

  abstract = {This study provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the discards produced by the commercial hydraulic dredging fleet targeting the clam, Chamelea gallina, in two Maritime Districts of the Adriatic Sea (Italy). Overall discards comprised just under 50\% of total catch in both Maritime Districts, approximately 30\% of which were undersized target species ({$<$}25 mm) and 20\% other benthic invertebrates, whilst fish were poorly represented. Significant differences in the proportions of the different catch components were found between the two Maritime Districts considered. Similarly, the size-frequencies of landed catch were significantly different between Districts. Great variability in overall catch composition from one Zone to another within one District was detected, emphasising the importance of a Zone-based management, rather than a District-based management.},

  abstract = {The squid Loligo vulgaris has an extended spawning season within the upwelling system off north-west Portugal, and its paralarvae may thus develop under a wide range of environmental conditions. Both temperature and salinity are expected to affect the metabolism of young squid and we tested their effects on growth during the embryonic and post-hatching phase, based on measurements of growth increments in statoliths of juveniles and adults, using generalized additive models. There was no evidence that statolith increments representing early growth become unreadable in adult statoliths. Variability in the statolith size at hatching was weakly but significantly related to the variables in the model. On the other hand, the effects on statolith growth of both sea surface temperature and of sea bottom temperature were significant during early post-hatching life. Thicker increments are deposited in the statoliths of squid living under higher temperatures, which results in summer hatchers having larger statoliths at the age of 90 days. Inspection of the statolith accretion pattern, using a piecewise linear regression method, revealed an ontogenetic shift in increment width, which may be an indication of the age of transition from paralarva to juvenile. On this basis, it is suggested that the planktonic stage lasts 60 or 90 days, depending on whether the paralarvae lived at higher (.158C) or lower (,158C) sea surface temperatures. The life strategy under warmer conditions potentially favours survival by reducing the duration of the vulnerable planktonic phase.},

  abstract = {Age and size-at-maturity of Loligo vulgaris from Portuguese waters were evaluated in order to explain its complex population structure, which is strongly influenced by continuous spawning. Age was obtained by increment counting in statoliths. Maturity ogives by age group indicated that males mature one month earlier (at 277 days) than females (at 298 days). Females mature at a ML50\% of 17.6 cm, while males mature at smaller sizes. The later, however, showed a high degree of complexity in the size at maturity with evidence of two size at maturity groups. In both sexes, maturity was ultimately found to be primarily dependent on size rather than age. The effect of hatching season on age-at-maturity, size-at-maturity and reproductive investment was analysed by comparing two groups of squid hatched under distinct environmental conditions, namely the temperature during the first 3 months of life, the cold cohort (CC), hatching between December and March and the warm cohort (WC), hatching between May and September. Significant differences were found between cohorts on age-at-maturity, size-at-maturity and reproductive investment, giving indication of the environmental influences on sexual maturity. CC squid mature ca. 2 months later in life than WC squid and at a significantly larger size. The reproductive investment as measured by GSI was higher in the WC squid. Much of the variability in age and size-at-maturity of females in the population was due to differences between cohorts but this was not the case for males.},

Given these features, the topography of the Portuguese coast, possible variations in fishing effort and reported increasing sea surface temperature in the last decades, we hypothesized that changes in marine communities in space and time occurred since 1990. In this study, research survey data collected yearly along the Portuguese continental slope (20--500 m deep) from 1990 to 2016 were analysed with the objective of identifying spatiotemporal changes. Latitude and depth were found to play a major role in communities' spatial differentiation, probably associated to temperature, and three ecological areas were defined (north, southwest and south). In the studied period, Macroramphosus spp. abundance showed a marked decrease in all areas whereas Sparids increased in abundance in the south. Despite these major changes and fluctuations in species abundance over time no major trends in communities were observed. Fishing activity, environmental conditions (including climate change) and biotic factors are all drivers possibly responsible for those changes.},

  abstract = {Effective species management requires good knowledge on vessel dynamics, either at a stock basis or through the establishment of multiannual management plans as advisable under the new European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Achieving such knowledge on Portuguese multi-gear fisheries is challenging given the large number of species caught and the different management measures applied to potential target species. The latter ranges from no input or output controls to output controls based on individual vessel quotas (IVQ). To provide accurate regional knowledge to the CFP, the dynamics of vessels involved in the trammel net fishery targeting anglerfish (Lophius spp.) was characterised based on onboard sampling data and logbook reports. The selected vessels were very dynamic, and were found to target other species such as hake (Merluccius merluccius), John Dory (Zeus faber) and octopus (Octopus vulgaris). Anglerfish landing trends can be explained by changes in abundance, quota availability and shifts/changes in fishing effort. Overall, the dynamics of these vessels varied with area of exploitation, IVQ value and anglerfish total allowable catch (TAC). These results show the influence of different management systems in the dynamics of vessels and the advantage of an IVQ management system, where fishers can spatially and temporally allocate effort. Results also highlight a fishing effort shift towards unregulated species in face of IVQ or TAC restrictions.},

The results for the three alternative scenarios estimated MSY between 3195 tons and 3341 tons. Stock status trajectories showed a typical anti-clockwise pattern, moving from initially underexploited through a period of unsustainable fishing, leading to a {$>$} 95\% probability of stock biomass in 2016 being below levels that can produce MSY. The 2016 fishing mortality rate estimates were close to or exceeding the sustainable exploitation levels that would be required to achieve rebuilding to biomass levels at MSY in the short- to medium term, albeit associated with high uncertainty. Based on multi-model inference from all three scenarios, there is a 97.2\% probability that the stock remains overfished and a 40.2\% probability that overfishing is still occurring.},

A series of parameters were obtained for each school (morphological, positional and energetic) as well as environmental factors (temperature and salinity). The relationships between the school parameters were analyzed by a PCA and then the school parameters per se were described using both univariate and multivariate analyses (Box-plots, ANOVAs, MANOVA, and discriminant analysis). The results show that significant differences exist between years and geographic areas in that the R{\'i}as Baixas schools were smaller in size and of higher density than those from the Cantabric area. These differences could be related to the facts that the R{\'i}as Baixas is a nursery zone and sardine length and age are smaller than in the Cantabric Sea. It would seem that the differences in school morphology and energetic characteristics related to length and age of individuals allow us to distinguish between the sardine echo traces in this area. There is a high annual variability in the number of schools and this is not a function of either survey design or strategy and it is not related to the abundance estimates of sardine. These results are important for both future species identification and the improvement of survey design and strategy.},

  abstract = {Fishery management is a complicated task that often results in overfishing, overcapacity, and low profits for the industry. The management of shared fish stocks is particularly problematic, especially if national authorities pursue different objectives. Multi-species fisheries add further complexity to the problem. It is no accident that management tools frequently used in Northern Europe, such as total allowable catches and individual quotas, are not applied in the Mediterranean Sea, where more target species are caught simultaneously. However, the European Commission intends to introduce a market-based driver for a strong, profitable fishing industry by phasing in transferable fishing concessions. This management approach is new for the Mediterranean, and it requires in-depth examination at institutional, legal, and economic levels. In this paper, after a review of the institutional setting, the economic perspective was analyzed by estimating the production function for the Italian small pelagic fishery in the Adriatic Sea. With the addition of Croatia to the European Union, the Adriatic Sea can become a Mediterranean communal exclusive fishing area. The results indicate that output measures such as total allowable catches and individual quotas should not cause serious discarding problems for this multi-species fishery.},

The research encompassed both morphometric and shape analyses of left sagittal otoliths extracted of 504 fish specimens. Four shape indices (Circularity, Roundness, Rectangularity, and Form-Factor) were significantly different between two groups, showing a statistical differentiation between two clear spatial units. The degree of divergence was even more pronounced along the rostrum, postrostrum, and excisura of the generated otolith outlines between these two groups. One group corresponds to the samples from the coastal areas in the Northeast Temperate Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (NETAM Area) and a second group from the coastal areas off the Eastern Tropical Atlantic coast of Africa (ETA Area). This study is the first to use otolith shape to differentiate tunas from separate spatial units.

Rapid proliferation of index use, with a piecemeal approach to research on the index, has led to a confusing array of equations and methods for developing these equations. We recommend that the regression-line-percentile (RLP) technique be adopted as a standardized method for developing standard weight (W,) equations, as good statistical consistency has been demonstrated for this approach. Equations should be modeled on 75th-percentile-weight data for consistent interpretation, and should be developed from data sets that represent the entire geographical range of a species. Standard weight should be considered a benchmark for comparison rather than a management target. Although the concept of a generalized "optimal" target range for W, is attractive, W, targets should be established for specific management objectives. Standard weight equations should be evaluated for length-related biases, and minimum applicable lengths for W, use should be defined. Standard weight equations proposed should be published in peer-reviewed literature to facilitate effective application and evaluation by the management community. Application of rigorous criteria to development of W, equations would standardize and clarify the theoretical basis of W, applications. Further research is needed to clarify the relation of condition indices to other measures of population structure and dynamics, and to develop valid W, equations for juvenile fish.},

The estimates of abundance and mean age from each haul were modelled as a function of year, area and depth and graphs were made showing the proportion of the abundance indices in each area of the coast for each year class. The hypothesis of ontogenic migrations of horse mackerel along the Iberian Atlantic coast is supported by the results obtained. These migrations seem to have two directions: one along the coast line and another perpendicular to the coast line, through different depths. The fish migrating through the Spanish area, from Biscay to North Galicia, are probably coming from the stock distributed from Norway through the west of the British Isles, with a southern boundary around Cape Finisterre. Off the Portuguese coast, most year classes seem to recruit to the northwest area, moving progressively to south, and in some cases, after reaching 7 years of age, returning back to northern waters.},

  abstract = {To identify the horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) stock units by the analysis of body shape, most of the species distribution range was sampled, and the morphometric measurements were analysed using discriminant analysis and Procrustes techniques. The results from both analyses showed a clear distinction between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples. For the Atlantic there is a latitudinal gradient, but with a clear boundary between three clusters corresponding to the North Sea, north of the Galician coast through the west of the British isles, and to the Portuguese coast and Gulf of Ca{\textasciiacute}diz. The relationship between the North African coast and these Atlantic stock units could not be fully clarified, because of a gap in the sampling coverage, corresponding to the Moroccan coast. The differences found between the sample collected in Mauritania and those from the Iberian coasts are not as marked as those between the Iberian samples and those to the north of Galicia. However, given the great distance between Mauritania and Iberia, it is necessary to analyse samples from contiguous locations in the Moroccan coast to clarify this question. Regarding the Mediterranean, three groups appeared to be distinct: a western one corresponding to the Balearic Islands, Albora{\textasciiacute}n Sea and Catalonia, an eastern one including the Ionian and Aegean Seas, and a central one with the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas, Sardinia and Sicily. The sampling scheme did not cover the Mediterranean coasts of North Africa and Middle-East, which can correspond to stock units unidentified in this study. The new perception of the stock units coming from this study gives stronger biological support to the routine assessments of the horse mackerel stocks.},

This is a seasonal activity and it involves the capture of fish from the wild and their rearing in sea cages for periods ranging between 3 months to 2 years. Short-term rearing is done mainly to: (a) achieve a greater body fat percentage and (b) obtain a better price by not flooding the market in the brief fishing period. Due to the increasing fear of a collapse of the fishery, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas currently reduced the total allowable catches for 2010 to 13,500 mtn from 32,000 mtn previously. Therefore, there is great interest in establishing a proper and sustainable tuna aquaculture industry. This necessitates the development of specific technologies for tuna aquaculture that will not rely on captured individuals from the wild, as it is practiced today. This article reviews the methods used for the farming and fattening of the species in the Mediterranean Sea, and the current status of the efforts at controlling reproduction in captivity.},

Here, we compared the development of schooling behavior in chub mackerel fed either Artemia nauplii (plankton-fed group) or the yolk-sac larvae of red sea bream (fish-fed group). Video recording was conducted in rearing tanks followed by analysis of separation swimming index as a criterion of schooling behavior. As a result, early juvenile mackerel in the plankton-fed group did not show schooling behavior up to day 22 (at 25 mm standard length (SL)), whereas those in the fish-fed group completed schooling behavior on day 18 (at 19 mm SL). Lack of schooling behavior in the planktonfed group may be attributed to the low level of highly unsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid, in their diet, without which a deficiency in the development of the central nervous systems may have occurred. Alternatively, chub mackerel juveniles in the plankton-rich environment may have adapted the balance of feeding and antipredator performance and, thus, delayed the development of schooling.},

Nonetheless, such species are often poorly studied, and information on their biological parameters must be gathered for effective population management. For 1 year, the reproductive strategy of the piper gurnard Trigla lyra and the red gurnard Chelidonichthys cuculus was studied by monthly samples obtained from commercial boats operating on western Portuguese coast. Both species showed a biased sex ratio towards females, especially for larger length classes. Length at first maturity could be estimated only for red gurnard (22.1 and 19.9 cm for females and males, respectively) because all piper gurnard individuals caught were mature. Piper gurnard showed determinate fecundity and a short spawning season, from November to February with a peak in January, whereas red gurnard showed indeterminate fecundity and a wide spawning season, from late December to May. The relative annual fecundity estimated for red gurnard (1893 {\textpm} 728 oocytes {\^A} g{\`A}1 eviscerated weight [EW]) was higher than the one estimated for piper gurnard (1018 {\textpm} 250 oocytes{\^A}g{\`A}1 EW).

Additional methods such as interpolating data through backcalculation may be used to account for sampling bias but are often complex and time-consuming. Here, we present an approach to improve plausibility in growth estimates when small individuals are under-sampled, based on Bayesian fitting growth models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with informative priors on growth parameters. Focusing on the blue jack mackerel, Trachurus picturatus, which is an important commercial fish in the southern northeast Atlantic, this Bayesian approach was evaluated in relation to standard growth model fitting methods, using both direct readings and back-calculation data. Matched growth parameter estimates were obtained with the von Bertalanffy growth function applied to back-calculated length at age and the Bayesian fitting, using MCMC to direct age readings, with both outperforming all other methods assessed. These results indicate that Bayesian inference may be a powerful addition in growth modelling using imperfect data and should be considered further in age and growth studies, provided relevant biological information can be gathered and included in the analyses.},

The frequency of occurrence of prey taxa, and the numerical frequency of fish and cephalopods, showed marked variations both spatially, across the breeding cycle and between years. Overall, cephalopods from 37 species representing 17 families and fish from 33 species representing 18 families were identified, representing over 70 prey species and trebling what was previously known. Histioteuthidae, Ommastrephidae and Cranchiidae were the only cephalopod families present every year and represented two thirds of the cephalopods' consumption by number.

Apart from blue jack mackerel, most fish species were present in very low numbers with the exception of Cubiceps gracilis, Scomberesox saurus and Maurolicus muellerii. Diaphus adenomus, was recorded for the first time for the Azores archipelago.},

  abstract = {The diel variation in feeding intensity and daily ration of the sardine Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) was investigated based on 50 pelagic trawl hauls carried out during the period of thermal stratification (July 2007 and July 2008) and mixing (December 2007 and February 2009) in a coastal area of the North Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean). Concurrently collected hydrographic (temperature and salinity), plankton (chlorophyll a, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and fish parameters (somatic condition, sexual maturity and catch per unit effort of sardine, CPUE) were used to explain seasonal and inter-annual variability in feeding periodicity and daily ration. A piecewise regression fitted to the weight-length data indicated a significant inflexion point at a length of {\textasciitilde}100 mm that was used to split the fish sample into adults and juveniles. The stomach fullness index (stomach content mass/fish mass) was strongly dependent on size, and a generalized linear model was used instead to standardize stomach content mass. During summer, sardine fed consistently during daytime with a prominent peak at around sunset. In winter, high feeding rates were recorded in the early night (first 6 h after sunset) but not in the second half of the night. Field estimates of gastric evacuation rate (R) ranged from 0.101 to 0.225 h-1 and were strongly related to temperature (T ) (R = 0.075e0.038T, r2 = 0.785). Daily rations were estimated by applying the Elliott-Persson and the Eggers models and varied from 2.02 to 3.67\% total weight (TW) in adults and 4.18 to 5.36\% TW in juveniles. A significant positive relationship emerged when daily ration was regressed against the ratio of mesozooplankton biomass to sardine CPUE, implying a density-dependent rate of food consumption.},

  title = {Fish Stock Assessment Manual},
  abstract = {The manual follows the same order of the lectures in the last course held in IPIMAR (November/December 1997). It starts with an introduction to the mathematical models applied in Fish Stock Assessment and some considerations on the importance of fisheries. The need for a rational management of the fishing resources is then stressed, this being indispensable for an adequate exploitation, aiming at conservation, to occur. The basic assumptions about a model and the concepts of different variation rates of a characteristic in relation to time (or to other characteristics) are presented, highlighting the most important aspects of the simple and exponential linear models which are used in the chapters that follow. After some considerations on the concept of cohort, models for the evolution in time of the number and weight of the individuals that constitute the cohort are developed, including models for the individual growth of the cohort. In the chapter concerning the study of the stock, the fishing pattern and its components are defined, the most used models for the stock{\'i}recruitment relation are presented, as well as the short and long term projections of a stock. With regard to fishing resources management, the discussion is focused on the biological reference points (target points, limit points and precautionary points) and fisheries regulation measures. The last chapter, which presents and discusses theoretical models of fish stock assessment, deals with production models (also designated as general production models) and with the long and short--term projections of the catches and biomasses. Finally, the general methods of estimating parameters are described and some of the most important methods are presented, with special relevance to the cohort analysis by age and length. Then a solution of the exercises from the last course held in IPIMAR, is presented by the author and the scientist Manuela Azevedo.},

Age readings were made on ethanol immersed whole otoliths. Different validation procedures were used to validate the age readings, namely back-calculation, monthly analysis of otoliths edge type and marginal increment. Age readings consistency and precision were assessed by measuring the error of different age readings performed by the author and between readers. The individuals sampled were divided in six age groups from 0 to V, without significant differences between males and females (P{$>$}0,05). The equation that better described the relationship between the length of fish and the otoliths radius was the equation of Dahl-Lea (LTi=(Ri/Rc) LTc ). The back-calculated mean lengths showed the inversed of Lee's phenomenon, and they were not significantly different (P{$>$}0,05) from the mean lengths at age estimated directly from the age-length key. Age reading's quality were assessed by using the Average Percent Error and Chang's Variation Index. The Percentage of Aggreement and Calibration Model were used to assess age readings between readers. The results obtained with the different methods were coherent and consistent. The values estimated for the monthly marginal increment and the analysis of the age type evolution confirmed the formation of one annual growth zone. The growth parameters of von Bertalanffy for T. picturatus were L{$\infty$}=42,6 cm, k=0,142 year-1 and t0=--2,673 year. The growth in weight is isometric with W{$\infty$}=727,6 g.},

  abstract = {Surface velocity estimates from wind and altimeter data, together with satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, were used to explore the advection patterns and environmental conditions using a simple Lagrangian model. Although the model is generic (only considering the physical transport), the results are of particular interest for sardine (Sardina pilchardus) early life stages, due to the spawning dynamics of the species off Iberia and NW Africa. Particles were released on the shelf of the Iberian and northern African Atlantic coasts every five days from 1998 to 2004 and advected for 27-days. Trajectories were computed using combinations of three surface velocity constituents: Ekman velocity, geostrophic velocity derived from sea level anomaly maps and mean geostrophic velocity derived from two mean dynamic topographies. Daily time series of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and water depth where constructed for each particle trajectory. The results showed strong regional and seasonal dependence of the transport due to wind, with average seasonal cycles of the percentage of particles found in the shelf reflecting the anticipated effect of the seasonal north--south migration of the trade wind belt. The addition of the geostrophic transport led to the attenuation of seasonal cycles and higher mean/maximum values in the probability of retention within the shelf. This increased capacity for retention even during strong upwelling conditions seems to have been overlooked by theories aiming to describe the reproductive strategies of pelagic fish and understand recruitment dynamics based primarily on wind variability. On the other hand, the average surface chlorophyll values indicated a distribution area with higher primary production for particles that never leave the shelf, in comparison to those that return to it or are found in the open sea a month after release, which is in agreement with existing hypotheses that offshore advection is detrimental to larval survival mainly due to the higher risk of starvation. Finally, the exchange between adjacent shelf areas was generally small (less than 5\%) within the study period, with the exception of the Gulf of Cadiz. In the latter area, up to 50\% of particles released in the southern Iberian shelf reached the Moroccan shelf in several events, contradicting previous suggestions that the Strait of Gibraltar acts as a physical barrier that promotes genetic differentiation among neighbouring sardine populations in the Atlantic. Overall, these results provide useful insights for the study of sardine dynamics in the northeast Atlantic but the unexpectedly high sensitivity of summary metrics (namely retention probability) to the choice of surface velocity field preclude firm conclusions and indicate alternative routes for future studies.},

Fishing is a traditional activity in Portugal and is mainly composed of a great number of small vessels. Given the lack of knowledge on effects of the Portuguese fishing fleet on seabird populations, bycatch was assessed in mainland coastal waters for 2010--2012. Interviews and on-board data were divided into 5 strata, according to fishing gear: Bottom trawling, Bottom longline, Purse seine, Beach seine, Polyvalent ({$\geq$}12 m) and Polyvalent ({$<$}12 m). Polyvalent included Setnets, Traps and Demersal longlines. Overall, 68 birds were recorded to be bycaught. The average catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 0.05 birds per fishing event. Polyvalent ({$<$}12 m), Polyvalent ({$\geq$}12 m) and Purse seiners had the biggest seabird bycatch rates, with 0.5 (CPUE = 0.1), 0.11 (CPUE = 0.05) and 0.2 (CPUE = 0.11) birds per trip, respectively. Within Polyvalent gear, Setnets captured the largest diversity of seabird species (CPUE = 0.06), while Demersal longline had the highest CPUE (0.86). Northern gannet was the most common bycaught species. Although more observation effort is required, our results suggest that substantial numbers of Balearic shearwater might be bycaught annually, mainly in Purse seine and Setnets.},

This was accomplished by estimating, for the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of all maritime countries and the high seas, the fraction currently left in the sea of the exploited populations of fish and invertebrates that occurred before the onset of large-scale industrial fishing. More precisely, the `fraction left' is the current biomass (B) of a stock relative to its initial biomass (B0), i.e., B/B0. This fraction was estimated for multiple exploited populations (or `stocks') by applying a versatile stock assessment method (CMSY++), whose main features are also described. Altogether, over 2,500 stocks of fish and marine invertebrates (mainly crustaceans such as lobsters and mollusks such as squids) were assessed in the EEZs of countries on five continents and the high seas. These assessments were based mainly on long catch time series (typically 1950 to 2018) but considered, wherever they were available, the results of earlier assessments made by national or international fisheries management bodies. Thus, the evaluations of fisheries status presented herein are not defined by data scarcity; rather, we used all available data pertinent to the status of fisheries in all maritime countries to reduce the uncertainty inherent in all stock assessments. The detailed results of these stock assessments and their supporting data are available on the Sea Around Us website (www.seaaroundus.org). These results will also be used by the Flourishing Ocean Initiative of the Minderoo Foundation, which kindly funded a large part of our catch reconstruction update to 2018 and the stock assessment work described herein.},

In all three species, the timing of spawning was consistent from year to year. Ovarian development in orange roughy and black oreo dory was found to be synchronous, with a single clutch of oocytes being matured for each spawning season. In males, testes of a given macroscopic stage were dominated by a single gamete stage, supporting the existence of a brief rather than prolonged spawning period.

To date, studies on fisheries discards have been primarily focused on large-scale fisheries and little attention was given to small-scale fisheries (SSF) discards. The multi-species and multi-gear nature of SSF in the Mediterranean makes any scientific effort to study discards and management action to regulate discards challenging. The study attempted, for the first time in Levantine Sea, to quantify discards, identify discarded species, and comprehend the causes and drivers of SSF discarding in Cyprus through 208 fishing trips by observing the fishers' regular fishing operations using trammel nets, gillnets, monofilament nets and bottom set longline. Out of the total catch, 1408.385 kg were landed and 956.581 kg were discarded. The majority of discarded individuals were nonindigenous species (73.7 \%). Results exhibited a discard rate of 9.92 individuals (4.6 Kg) and a mortality rate of 0.86 per sampled fishing trip, indicating that almost all individuals discarded were released dead. The pro\- portional discards rate (\%) out of the total catch was calculated at about 41 \% and the average landings/discards ratio in terms of weight was 1.5:1. The five most common discarded species in terms of numbers belonged to osteichthyes and were Sargocentron rubrum followed by Lagocephalus sceleratus, Torquigener flavimaculosus, Scorpaena scrofa and Pterois miles representing 27.8 \%, 25.2 \%, 13.9 \%, 4.7 \% and 2.4 \%, respectively, of all discarded species. `Poisonous fish', `undersized fish' and `low' and `no commercial value' fish were the main reasons for discarding. Other reasons included `prohibited' to land species, `poor condition' and `depredated' fish. Elasmobranchs were the second most abundant class accounting for 4.3 \% of the total discarded taxa, including threatened, endangered and critically endangered species. Net length, soak time, gear type, and sea\- sonality are the main factors driving discards. The findings of the current work could support the development of national fishery-specific management action plans to mitigate discards and impact on marine ecosystems.},

To date most phylogenetic studies on this order have been based on morpho-anatomical criteria, whereas only a few sequence comparisons based studies have been reported. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships of 30 flatfish species pertaining to seven different families were examined by sequence analysis of the first half of the 16S mitochondrial DNA gene. The results obtained did not support percoids as the sister group of pleuronectiforms. The monophyletic origin of most families analyzed, Soleidae, Scophthalmidae, Achiridae, Pleuronectidae and Bothidae, was strongly supported, except for Paralichthyidae which was clearly subdivided into two groups, one of them associated with high confidence to Pleuronectidae. The analysis of the 16S rRNA gene also suggested the monophyly of Pleuronectiforms as the most probable hypothesis and consistently supported some major interfamily groupings.},

The fleet is very aged, since 39\% of the vessels is less than 17 years old, considering 1997 as the year of reference. For the great majority of vessels (79\%), the length varies between 16 and 26 meters, the beam is limited between 4,5 and 6 meters and the depth varying between 1,5 and 2,5 meters. The most relevant regional fleets are those of the Norte, Lisboa e Vale do Tejo and Algarve, each representing about 30\% of the total number of vessels, gross registered tonnage and engine power. Significant correlations were observed between some fleet parameters (linear dimensions, net registered tonnage, engine power, year of built) as well between vessel produtivity (Kg/trip) and length overall.},

We conclude that both genera are monotypic and that the differences between populations of Sardinops in different current systems are not large enough to consider them distinct subspecies. Analysis of biochemical genetics information, fossil evidence, and present and paleo-climatic conditions suggests that Sardinops did not achieve its present distribution until the Pleistocene and that westward exchange of sardines via the northern and southern west wind drift regions is possible with present climatic conditions. Transequator exchange appears to be possible only during glacial maxima and only in the eastern tropical Pacific.},

Sampling was conducted in three areas representative of different environmental situations along the gradient: (a) a non-eutrophic area (Zostera noltii meadows), (b) an intermediate eutrophic area (macrophyte absent, although residual roots can still be found in the sediment, and the occasional formation of abundant macroalgae mats) and (c) a strongly eutrophic area (macrophyte community totally absent for at least a decade and strong, regularly occurring, blooms of Ulva spp.). Field, laboratory and literature information were used to construct the models, as well as empirical ecological knowledge gained from years of work on this system. Approximately 76 trophic groups (e.g. Phytoplankton and Zooplankton species), species and genera were included. These species were grouped into 43, 36 and 34 model groups for Zostera sp. meadows, intermediate eutrophic area and strongly eutrophic area, respectively. The groups were arranged by trophic similarity and habitat preferences; special distinction is given to macrofauna. Biomass, production, consumption, and diet are among the parameters used to describe each group. The sum of consumptions, exports, respiration, production, flow to detritus, total system throughput and annual rate of net primary production was always higher in the Zostera sp. meadows, followed by the strongly eutrophic area and, finally, by the intermediate eutrophic area.},

It is the common motherboard interface for personal computers' graphics cards, hard disk drive host adapters, SSDs, Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware connections. PCIe has numerous improvements over the older standards, including higher maximum system bus throughput, lower I/O pin count and smaller physical footprint, better performance scaling for bus devices, a more detailed error detection and reporting mechanism (Advanced Error Reporting, AER), and native hot-swap functionality. More recent revisions of the PCIe standard provide hardware support for I/O virtualization. Defined by its number of lanes, (the number of simultaneous sending and receiving lines of data as in a highway which features traffic in both directions) the PCI Express electrical interface is also used in a variety of other standards, most notably the laptop expansion card interface ExpressCard and computer storage interfaces SATA Express, U.2 (SFF-8639) and M.2.

  abstract = {A variety of density-dependent and -independent processes have been proposed to influence natural mortality rates, potentially leading to variation through time. Processes of natural mortalities are rarely directly observed, making estimation of natural mortality rates difficult. Mark-recapture data allow estimation of total mortality rates, which can be separated into natural and fishing mortality with information on rates of tag reporting, tag shedding and tag-induced mortality. We fitted attrition models and length-based Brownie models to four decades of mark-recapture data from skipjack and yellowfin tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, a period representing a sustained expansion of associated fisheries in the region as well as rapid changes to the marine environment. The modelled dataset included c. 250,000 skipjack and 100,000 yellowfin tag releases, with 45,000 and 17,000 recoveries of skipjack and yellowfin respectively, released from 1977 to 2017. Increases in fishing mortality were detected over this time for both skipjack and yellowfin, with evidence of temporal changes in selectivity for yellowfin. Estimates of natural mortality were highest for the smallest size class and generally lower for larger sizes, though there was large uncertainty in the largest size groups due to lower sample sizes of tagged fish. There was no clear evidence of temporal changes in natural mortality rates for either species, though there was some evidence of changes in natural mortality for the smaller yellowfin size classes ({$<$} 61 cm). However, there was likely insufficient statistical power to test for plausible changes in natural mortality rates for yellowfin due to low precision of estimates during the earlier years of the tag dataset.},

  abstract = {Economic profitability and responsible fisheries are objectives of fishermen and fisheries managers. In purse seine fisheries, an accurate biomass estimate of the targeted school is crucial to accomplish this. For this study, omnidirectional fisheries sonar was used to estimate individual school biomass of Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). A sonar sampling design based on professional skipper's experience provided detailed information on school dimensions and acoustic backscattering. Using calibrated digital sonar data, school volume and fish densities were obtained, and school biomass computed. A positive linear relation was found between the estimated sonar school biomass and purse seine catches for both species (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.92; residual standard error, RSE {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4.7 t). Large variability in volume backscattering coefficient and uncertainty in side-aspect target strength (TS) are the main sources of discrepancy between the estimates and the catch. Using a 4 dB (39\%) weaker mean TS for mean side-aspect TS than the normal mean dorsal aspect TS was needed for optimizing the 1:1 relationship between sonar biomass estimate and catch. Accurate estimation of single school biomass can reduce the catch of unexpectedly large schools, leading to improvements in economic efficiency and reduced release of dead or dying fish.},

These techniques aim at revealing growth increments in the rostrum sagittal sections (RSS) and lateral wall surfaces (LWS) of octopus upper and lower beaks. Both methods were improved to reduce the time of sample preparation and to enhance the appearance of the increments. For each individual, two independent readings were done for upper and lower beak sections, as well as for the lateral wall surfaces. Vertical reflected light (epifluorescence) and image analysis system were shown to be useful in the observation and analysis of the sequence of increments. Precision of the ageing, increment counts obtained by both techniques, and increment widths were discussed. Using upper beak RSS led to more precise age estimates, whereas preparing LWS was quicker and simpler, and revealed a higher number of increments. Therefore, our study recommends counting growth increments in LWS of beaks to age adult common octopus.},

A total of 86 fishing surveys were performed during the fishing season (May--September) from 2009 to 2014, on sandy bottoms at bathymetrics ranging from 8 to 10 m depth. During the whole study period, fishing operations involved 6311 cuttlefish traps with a gear catch rate of 37\% (frequency of traps with cuttlefish) and a mean of 0.9 S. officinalis caught per trap. A total of 5883 S. officinalis (1424.0 kg) were caught, being only recorded 282 dead individuals (mortality rate of 4.6\%). The mean fishing yield (standardised CPUE's in number and weight) was 46.6 individuals and 11.3 kg 50 traps-1. Overall, males (n = 3188) outnumbered females (n = 2695), producing a significant male-biased (1 M: 0.85 F) sex ratio. On average, females were significantly larger and heavier (124.4 {\textpm} 22.9 mm ML; 253.1 {\textpm} 148.8 g TW) than males (121.9 {\textpm} 24.0 mm ML; 230.7 {\textpm} 143.1 g TW). Accordingly, the length-frequency distributions displayed significant gender differences, with 89.6\% of females and 85.8\% of males accomplishing the MCRS (100 mm ML). This markedly seasonal, highly sustainable and low impacting small-scale fishery constitutes a locally important socio-economic activity during spring and summer. Undamaged catches and highly fresh individuals further contribute to the considerable price reached by S. officinalis caught using this artisanal fishing gear.},

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established across all marine environments, though their coherence and effectiveness in protecting umbrella species remains unclear. We used a multi-model ensemble forecasting approach, on 8 years of at-sea censuses of 30 seabird species to identify candidate MPAs in the Portuguese coast, prioritizing important areas for their conservation based on their occurrence and distribution. We overlapped the outputs generated by the Ensemble Ecological Niche Models (EENMs) with layers representing important environmental stressors (fishing intensity, ship density and oil pollution risk), and calculated loss in conservation value using them as cost layers. Three key marine areas were identified along the Portuguese coast: For breeders, there was a key marine area encompassing the Tagus and Sado estuaries and Berlengas archipelago; for nonbreeders and migratory species two important areas were identified in the Northern and Southern coast. The key marine area identified in the Northern coast is characterized by high productivity and biodiversity, and can be affected by oil pollution from the refineries and the intensive ship traffic in this area. Also, the area identified in the Southern coast of Portugal for migratory seabirds overlaps extensively with areas of high fishing activity. Our results show that the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) established along the Portuguese coast protect more than a third of the areas that we prioritized for breeding species and the official MPAs near 65\% of the same areas. In contrast, current IBAs and national legislation protect less than 4\% of the coastal areas that we prioritize for non-breeding species in this study. Our study, combining multi-species distribution with environmental constraints induced by human activities, allowed us to assess the coherence of the Portuguese marine planning and identify candidate areas to join the Portuguese network of marine protected areas. Our results, employing data from annual at-sea surveys together with the human stressors known to affect the Portuguese coast, proved to be an extremely useful strategy to identify spatial conservation areas along the Portuguese coast as well as to access the adequacy and consistency of those areas. Despite the constraints of this demanding approach, we are confident that our study provides a reliable strategy to inform marine conservation efforts and management planning in similar coastal environments elsewhere, characterized by strong coastal upwelling movements.},

  abstract = {Stock assessment models often require an external estimate of the natural mortality rate (M) that is usually assumed to be the same for all ages and years in the model. Although the fixed M assumption can be a major oversimplification, model diagnostics (e.g. profile likelihoods) that can help provide an understanding of how the choice of M affects model fit are often not used in practice. In the state-space setting, model diagnostics are especially complicated because of the complex dependencies in the data caused by process errors. To get a better understanding of the effect of broad changes in M across all ages and years on the state-space model fit, we develop new methods that provide profile likelihoods for individual data sources (surveys, landings, age com\- positions) by decomposing the state-space integrated likelihood. We also use local influence diagnostics to assess the influence of age and year specific changes in M on model fit. We jointly call these methods M diagnostics and apply them to a case study for American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland. The M diagnostics indicate that most input data sources are fit better with a higher M in recent years. We suggest that M diagnostics should be routinely examined when formulating an assessment model.},

We use a cross-disciplinary approach combining genetics, transport modelling, survey time series analyses and physical oceanographic modelling to investigate 3 hypotheses on the reasons for this change. Evidence from connectivity studies suggests that the population of North Sea anchovy is separate from that in the Bay of Biscay. The recruitment pulses observed in survey data fit a life cycle which includes spawning in early summer and larval development in late summer. This also supports the concept of population expansion originating from local remnant population(s). In terms of growth physiology, suitable thermal windows have expanded, making conditions more favourable for life cycle closure and population persistence/productivity. In addition to the increased frequency of warm summers, which favour larvae and juvenile growth, the decrease in the number of severe winters is also likely to improve overwinter survival. Overall, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the increase in anchovy abundance originated from the improved productivity of existing populations. This increase was associated with an expansion in thermal habitats and is probably not due to a northward shift in the distribution of southern conspecifics.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns in catch rates and in allocation of fishing effort were analysed for the coastal fishery in Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, to assess whether fishermen can optimise their strategy from catch information, or whether they fish under great uncertainty and merely minimise risks. On average 517 fishing units operated in the 2800 km2 area, catching 21 t fish day-1. Major gear categories were hook and line (59\% of total effort and 5\% of total catch), and lift nets (16\% of total effort and 70\% of total catch). The size of individual resource spaces varied with gear type and was smaller in unfavourable weather conditions. Although spatial patterns in catch rates at the scale of the whole archipelago were evident, fishermen could not differentiate between locations, as catch variance within their individual resource spaces was high relative to the contrasts in spatial patterns. The aggregated distribution of fishing effort in Spermonde must be explained by factors such as the small scale of operations, rather than fish abundance.},

  abstract = {Observers were placed on pelagic vessels in the Scottish fisheries for mackerel (Scomber scombrus), herring (Clupea harengus), ``maatje'' herring (herring caught just before their first spawning) and argentines (Argentina silus) to monitor by-catch composition and discarding practices. A total of 67 days was spent at sea, 11 on the argentine fleet, 28 on the herring fleet, 12 on the ``maatje'' herring fleet and 16 on the mackerel fleet. The level of by-catch generally ranged from {$<$}1\% to around 2.5\% of the total catch. The argentine fishery took a significant proportion of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) (approx. 10\% of the overall catch) but this was landed and sold in the market. The greatest range of by-catch species was found in the argentine fishery, including 11 species of fish and one species of squid. Discarding rates in the fisheries varied, with herring and argentine fisheries showing no discards, the mackerel fishery a discard rate of around 4\% and the ``maatje'' herring fishery a discard rate of around 11\%. By-catches included small numbers of gannets (Morus bassanus) but no marine mammals. If the sampled trips were representative, results indicate that marine mammal by-catch events typically occur during less than one in 20 hauls in the fisheries studied. A larger scale study is needed to confirm this. Cetaceans were sighted in the vicinity of the fishing boats during 4\% of observed fishing activities. {\copyright} 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/{\'E}ditions scientifiques et m{\'e}dicales Elsevier SAS.

  abstract = {Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) were initially projected for the sole purpose of monitoring commercial fisheries. However, the data they generate are increasingly being viewed as essential in commercial stock research and management. The usefulness of these data for a correct estimation of the fishing effort depends on their coverage of the different operational phases of a fishing trip, which may be highly conditioned by the frequency they are received onshore. As such, considering that the present rate of reception consists in one ping each two-hour and taking into account the diversity of fishing gears and their operation modes, the estimation of a minimum rate is of the utmost relevance. An example is presented for two coastal trawlers engaged in crustacean and fish trawling off the Portuguese continental coast, for which we have quantified bias both in the numbers of fishing hauls estimated and the total towing time, by comparing a high-quality VMS dataset with 10-minute interval between pings with datasets of 30-min, 1-h and 2-h intervals. For fishing trips targeting crustaceans, the adoption of a 2-hour interval between registers resulted in 89\% missed fishing hauls and a decrease of 70\% in the total time trawled when compared to the 10-min interval data. In fishing trips for fish species, the percentage of missed hauls was similar, while the decrease in total time trawled attained 84\%.},

  abstract = {The European Union (EU) is one of the most important markets for cephalopods in the world. Currently, smallscale fisheries targeting the common octopus in the EU are of considerable social and economic importance, especially in southern European waters where more octopus are consumed as part of the traditional diet. Oc\- topuses in Europe are excluded from quota regulations under the Common Fisheries Policy and EU Member States manage their fisheries employing different input and output control measures, especially in small-scale fisheries targeting the common octopus. The level of participation of the fishing industry in the management of their activity varies amongst Member States and some management arrangements in place are tailored at the local level. This manuscript focuses on four European countries with important small-scale artisanal common octopus fisheries (Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece). It describes and compares the current status of small-scale common octopus fisheries in each country, their socioeconomic importance, the management arrangements in place, and the opportunities and challenges for their future. Despite the increasing importance of octopus fish\- eries in southern Europe, few countries have collected detailed data on the socioeconomic importance and management of these fisheries. The information provided contributes to increase the knowledge about the human dimensions of octopus fisheries in Europe.},

  abstract = {Stock assessment models often assume natural mortality rates (M) are constant and attribute the variability in a stock's overall mortality rate to variability in fishing mortality and recruitment. However, this assumption may not be valid if M varies due to both direct and indirect trophic interactions as well as environmental variability. This is particularly the case when there are substantial changes in the overlapping abundances of a key predator or prey species, or extreme environmental changes impacting an ecosystem. Hence multispecies models (MSMs) are used to explicitly capture variations in natural mortality rates and improve the ability to discriminate be\- tween mortality due to fishing versus natural mortality, plus quantify the influences of fishing on the broader ecosystem, consistent with an ecosystem approach to fishing (EAF). There are a growing number of approaches to modelling natural mortality rates in MSMs, with models developed for tactical applications requiring a higher level of rigour and consideration of uncertainty than broad strategic ecosystem models. We overview approaches to modelling natural mortality in Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments (MICE) and use four case studies to highlight lessons learnt, applications and provide some guidelines going forward. We identify ten broad application categories for MSMs (incorporating explicit representation of components of M), to advance EAF. These include: (1) quantify variability in natural mortality by age and over time as inputs to single species stock assessment models, because of the recognition that predation mortality (M2) is a large and variable portion of total M; (2) inform ecosystem reference points; (3) use as operating models in Management Strategy Evaluation frameworks; (4) simulation test broader management levers; (5) optimise multispecies harvest stra\- tegies; (6) inform on management of bycatch and `choke' species; (7) represent and forward project trajectories and model recovery scenarios for threatened and protected species; (8) correctly attribute sources of mortality to support management efforts; (9) pest management and (10) broader applications (e.g. habitat alterations). Using well-constructed MSMs to correctly specify M reduces bias in model parameters, reference points and projections and is increasingly important as ecosystems respond to a more variable and changing climate.},

We compare these approaches using real and simulated data sets, and conclude that they yield substantially different interpretations of productivity. Effort-averaging methods assume the stock is in equilibrium relative to the recent effort; this assumption is rarely satisfied and usually leads to overestimation of potential yield and optimum effort. Effort-averaging methods will almost always produce what appears to be "reasonable" estimates of maximum sustainable yield and optimum effort, and the r               2               statistic used to evaluate the goodness of fit can provide an unrealistic illusion of confidence about the parameter estimates obtained. Process-error estimators produce much less reliable estimates than observation-error estimators. The observation-error estimator provides the lowest estimates of maximum sustainable yield and optimum effort and is the least biased and the most precise (shown in Monte-Carlo trials). We suggest that observation-error estimators be used when fitting surplus production models, that effort-averaging methods be abandoned, and that process-error estimators should only be applied if simulation studies and practical experience suggest that they will be superior to observation-error estimators.},

  abstract = {Every year, marine scientists around the world read thousands of otolith or scale images to determine the age structure of commercial fish stocks. This knowledge is important for fisheries and conservation management. However, the age-reading procedure is time-consuming and costly to perform due to the specialized expertise and labor needed to identify annual growth zones in otoliths. Effective automated systems are needed to increase throughput and reduce cost. DeepOtolith is an open-source artificial intelligence (AI) platform that addresses this issue by providing a web system with a simple interface that automatically estimates fish age by combining otolith images with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks that has been a dominant method in computer vision tasks. Users can upload otolith image data for selective fish species, and the platform returns age estimates. The estimates of multiple images can be exported to conduct conclusions or further age-related research. DeepOtolith currently contains classifiers/regressors for three fish species; however, more species will be included as related work on ageing will be tested and published soon. Herein, the architecture and functionality of the platform are presented. Current limitations and future directions are also discussed. Overall, DeepOtolith should be considered as the first step towards building a community of marine ecologists, machine learning experts, and stakeholders that will collaborate to support the conservation of fishery resources.},

  abstract = {The authors have collaborated for the past 40 years on a sequence of initiatives for a range of fisheries and marine ecosystems projects. These had natural mortality (M) as a common thread and have helped increase understanding of this elusive parameter. Here, we provide a reprise as well as an extension of our earlier results. Taken together, these help to develop an understanding of M of exploited fish stocks, particularly those of the North Sea. Firstly, a reprisal is given of the key findings about M due to predation by important fish stocks of the North Sea. Estimates were first produced by the ICES Multispecies Working Group using multispecies virtual population analysis (MSVPA) in combination with extensive stomach content data - collected for all four quarters and around the whole North Sea during 1981. Results from this initiative demonstrate that predation mortality (M2) represents a large portion of M for many North Sea fish species, but varies markedly both by age and by year, thus refuting the then widely adopted hypothesis that M was constant. Moreover, these variations were sufficiently large to overturn single species predictions of sustainable yield. M2 results from the 1980{$\prime$}s also indicated that mortality levels were related to prey size and species. The paper then reprises results from studies made by the private working group (PWG) that the authors formed to continue their collaboration. These focused first on size spectra of fish communities both by data analysis and by developing a simple trait-based model (cartoon) of the North Sea - the charmingly simple model (CSM). This modelling led to further questions about the basis of the coexistence of fish species in an ecosystem given that egg production scales approximately with asymptotic weight. This led to a plausible hypothesis that differential natural mortality rates are required that increase with the von Bertalanffy parameters of curvature K and asymptotic length L{$\infty$}, but decrease with fish length. Data from the literature supported this hypothesis, which was further refined into canonical form: M=K (L{$\infty$}/L)1.5. However, this hypothesis is also questioned because this form might not be compatible with the predicted and observable fact that size-spectra slopes become more negative with increased general levels of fishing. Clearly, changes in size spectra should cause changes in M2. Results of new modelling work are presented where the CSM is modified to include differential natural mortality rates by K and L{$\infty$}. The results suggest that M responds both to general levels of fishing and the slope of the ensuing size spectrum. This suggests that a more general expression for predation mortality would be M2={$\alpha$}(F)K(L{$\infty\chi$} )(L{$\beta$}(F)), where {$\chi$} is likely to be close to the 1.5 value used in the canonical form. The work thus provides a likely form for M2 but by no means a universally applicable formula. It remains a hypothesis needing to be tested and perhaps calibrated against data from the sea. Such calibrations might indeed point toward a universal formula for M2.},

Mass and volume values were obtained by applying Archimedes' principle to weights of fish obtained while they were immersed in waters of different densities. The allometric relationship of mass, volume, and length was determined for each group using principal component analysis. Fish in each treatment group had different mass-volume-length trajectories. Immigrating fish had the least mass and volume at fixed length, followed by settled fish, and laboratory-reared fish had the greatest mass at fixed length. Mass and volume differences between freshly captured settled fish and starved fish were slight. All treatments showed great variability in body mass and volume at fixed length, and the use of fish length alone as an index of fish size is problematic. It is suggested that centroid size is a better measurement of fish size when size is an important variate in a study.},

Patterns were analysed by stranding rates (individuals/1000 km of coastline) of groups and species; for the 14 most numerous species, we also fitted generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) using temporal and spatial explanatory variables. We recorded 53850 animals (22738 sea turtles, 28155 birds, and 2957 cetaceans) of 78 species. Higher stranding numbers were observed during winter/spring for all groups, and could be an effect of a higher occurrence/abundance at the region, driven by productive waters, jointly with higher stranding probabilities due to stronger drifting forces. Most modelled species showed temporal and spatial stranding patterns most likely related to their general occurrence/abundance cycles in southeast Brazil, but for Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, Pontoporia blainvillei, and Sotalia guianensis local mortality factors may be influencing stranding numbers. By using intensive, wide ranging beach surveys and including survey effort in the analysis, we provide a comprehensive baseline for stranding numbers in the region, and open a pathway for future hypothesis-testing studies to investigate its drivers.},

The meagre (Argyrosomus regius) is one of the world's largest sciaenids and supports a significant regional fishery in European and North African waters whose reproductive patterns are yet to be fully investigated. In the present study, we derive a macroscopic grading system for meagre testis using semi-quantitative graphs that feature the testis variability along the species size range and time of the year. We then describe the histological stages and reproductive phases of male testes and determine the extent to which they corroborate the anatomical scale. Our results indicate that gross anatomical analyses are accurate in assessments of the meagre spawning season but may not precisely distinguish the testes of well-mature fish and first spawning virgins. Furthermore, we show that milt expression varies widely with size and misclassifies as immature many smaller fish in spawning-capable condition. We discuss these findings in terms of their contribution to the understanding of testes development and the uncertainties involved in determining the size-at-maturity of male fish using gross anatomical scales.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that Mediterranean loggerhead turtles are listed as ``Least Concern'' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), they are among the most threatened marine megafauna worldwide, because of fishery-related incidental captures. The northern central Adriatic Sea is one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea and it supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including sea turtles. This study assesses the spatial and seasonal impact of the northern central Adriatic midwater pair trawl fishery on loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2018 and environmental variables. The model predicted seasonal variation of loggerhead distribution. According to previous studies, data analysis indicates that most bycatch events of loggerhead turtle occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The present data confirm that the northern Adriatic may be an important foraging area for loggerhead turtle. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between sea turtles and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures in critical habitats.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is often considered to be one of the most important parameters in a fish stock assessment and affects productivity estimates for the population. However, it is also among the most difficult parameters to estimate using commonly available data. The magnitude of error (both bias and variance) when estimating this parameter can be substantial and can be affected by ignoring its variation over time, space, age, and length. In this study we explore the implications of errors in M on estimation and management performance using simu\- lations and illustrative examples. The error in management reference points such as F35\% and FMSY is related directly to the error associated with M. Estimates of biomass are expected to be positively biased when M is overestimated and vice versa. Use of feedback management strategies reduces the impact of errors in M, but per\- formance in meeting management objectives is compromised when M is in error. Estimating M was found to perform better than pre-specifying M in closed-loop simulations. Also, we found that the consequences of setting M to an incorrect value were reduced if stock-recruitment steepness was estimated. Based on our study and a review of related work, we advocate estimating M within an assessment, ideally with a prior for M tailored to the stock concerned.},

  abstract = {The present review addresses recent findings made in the western Iberia ecosystem on the behavioural and physical interactions that regulate dispersal, supply to coastal habitats and settlement of invertebrate larvae. These studies used the barnacle Chthamalus spp. and the crab Carcinus maenas as model organisms. The observations made on the Iberian shelf showed extensive diel vertical migrations along the water column by representatives of both groups that have never been reported before. The interaction of the diel vertical migration with the two-layer flow structure of upwelling/downwelling circulation suggests a mechanism that may help to retain larvae in shelf waters during upwelling conditions. Measurements of daily supply of C. maenas megalopae to estuaries separated by 500 km disclosed a semilunar pattern, with highest supply around highest amplitude tides, indicating that supply of megalopae to estuaries is accomplished by selective tidal stream transport. Relaxation of equatorward winds also played a role in supply, by enhancing translocation of megalopae to the nearshore. Concerning Chthamalus larvae, the observations on daily settlement made at rocky shores also separated by 500 km showed unclear patterns between locations and years. The relationship of settlement with water temperature, tidal range and upwelling indices indicated that supply of barnacle cyprids may be controlled by multiple mechanisms, viz. upwelling/downwelling circulation, internal tidal bores and sea breezes.},

  abstract = {Significance             Shark populations are declining worldwide because of overexploitation by fisheries with unknown consequences for ecosystems. Although the harvest of oceanic sharks remains largely unregulated, knowing precisely where they interact with fishing vessels will better aid their conservation. We satellite track six species of shark and two entire longline fishing vessel fleets across the North Atlantic over multiple years. Sharks actively select and aggregate in space-use ``hotspots'' characterized by thermal fronts and high productivity. However, longline fishing vessels also target these habitats and efficiently track shark movements seasonally, leading to an 80\% spatial overlap. Areas of highest overlap between sharks and fishing vessels show persistence between years, suggesting current hotspots are at risk, and arguing for introduction of international catch limits.           ,              Overfishing is arguably the greatest ecological threat facing the oceans, yet catches of many highly migratory fishes including oceanic sharks remain largely unregulated with poor monitoring and data reporting. Oceanic shark conservation is hampered by basic knowledge gaps about where sharks aggregate across population ranges and precisely where they overlap with fishers. Using satellite tracking data from six shark species across the North Atlantic, we show that pelagic sharks occupy predictable habitat hotspots of high space use. Movement modeling showed sharks preferred habitats characterized by strong sea surface-temperature gradients (fronts) over other available habitats. However, simultaneous Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of the entire Spanish and Portuguese longline-vessel fishing fleets show an 80\% overlap of fished areas with hotspots, potentially increasing shark susceptibility to fishing exploitation. Regions of high overlap between oceanic tagged sharks and longliners included the North Atlantic Current/Labrador Current convergence zone and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge southwest of the Azores. In these main regions, and subareas within them, shark/vessel co-occurrence was spatially and temporally persistent between years, highlighting how broadly the fishing exploitation efficiently ``tracks'' oceanic sharks within their space-use hotspots year-round. Given this intense focus of longliners on shark hotspots, our study argues the need for international catch limits for pelagic sharks and identifies a future role of combining fine-scale fish and vessel telemetry to inform the ocean-scale management of fisheries.},

  abstract = {Starvation is a ubiquitous process in nature as all animals depend on finite resources to survive. Limited food resources can lead to starvation-induced mortality and, depending on the scale of the limitation, population-level consequences may emerge. However, attempts to model starvation-induced mortality are rare as it is difficult to isolate the effects of specific sources of natural mortality. Using commonly collected data on body condition, we develop a statistical approach to index starvation-induced mortality by estimating the proportion of individuals experiencing severe emaciation in a fish population. This approach accounts for seasonal patterns in body condition, allowing data collected at any time of year to be included. Using Canada's Northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock as a case study, we found a positive association between rates of natural mortality estimated by an integrated population model and the index of mortality derived from proportions of cod in poor condition. This index is also associated with the availability of two key prey species, capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). Taken together, our results indicate that starvation-induced mortality represents an important component of the natural mortality experienced by Northern cod, supporting the idea that insufficient food contributed to the collapse of the stock in the early 1990s and, subsequently, limited its recovery. These implications highlight the practical relevance of explicitly considering prey availability (e.g., through body condition or prey abundance indices) to improve stock assessment modeling and aid the development of actionable ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies.},

  abstract = {The widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas) inhabits the continental shelf and upper slope of the west coast of North America. The U.S. west coast widow rockfish stock has declined since the mid-1980s, leading to implementation of increasingly stringent management restrictions upon the commercial fishery. The low numbers, patchy distribution, and preference for rocky habitats of the widow rockfish make this stock difficult to monitor using standard bottom trawl survey techniques and commercial landings data; currently, there is no reliable index of abundance. An ad hoc government-industry working group began meeting in 2004 to devise a new stock assessment survey strategy. The proposed strategy utilized local fishermen's knowledge of widow rockfish distribution and behavior, chartered commercial fishing vessels, and a combination of fisheries acoustics and underwater video sampling techniques. Results are presented from fieldwork conducted at three study sites off the central coast of Oregon, USA, in March 2005. Acoustic backscatter at 38 kHz between 50 m from the surface to 15 m off the bottom was attributed primarily to widow rockfish. This classification was based on historical widow rockfish distribution at these sites, fish school appearance on acoustic echograms, and deployments of an underwater camera sled. Repeated acoustic sampling along predetermined transects spaced at 0.3 nmi (0.56 km) at two of the study sites documented the temporal and spatial variability of widow rockfish schools over the course of a single day and week-to-week. The CVs of average vertically integrated acoustic backscatter measured in repeated sampling passes at these two sites were 0.31 and 0.36, which are not unreasonable values for a fisheries survey time series. Fine-scale acoustic sampling at a total of three study sites showed that the spatial scale (horizontal dimensions) of the groups of widow rockfish schools observed ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 nmi (0.37--1.48 km). This study demonstrates that sampling of a coastwide suite of study sites selected using local fishermen's knowledge with a standard 38 kHz scientific echosounder, supported by underwater video and limited midwater trawling, may be a promising way of monitoring U.S. west coast widow rockfish abundance. These techniques may also be relevant to monitoring other difficult-to-assess semidermersal species inhabiting rocky, untrawlable areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract             According to density-dependent habitat selection theory, areas of high density can be indicative of high population productivity and have positive individual fitness consequences. Here, we explore six groundfish populations on the Scotian Shelf, Canada, where a decline in areas of high density beyond a certain threshold is associated with disproportionately large declines in Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB). This is evidenced by empirical, concave, positive relationships between high-density areas (HDAs) and SSB. We introduce a methodology to estimate the threshold below which SSB declines increasingly faster per unit of HDA decline. The spatial threshold among these six stocks was remarkably consistent; when stocks lose 70--80\% of HDAs, disproportionately large SSB declines are likely to occur. We propose that spatial thresholds could serve as spatial reference points to complement existing SSB limit reference points (LRPs). For some stocks we identify spatial thresholds which correspond to SSB levels that exceed those associated with the designated SSB LRP, suggesting that a review of these SSB LRPs warrants merit. For other stocks, spatial reference points can be used in concert with SSB reference points, strengthening efforts to incorporate a precautionary approach to fisheries management. Our results warrant further research into the general application of HDA as spatial limit and target reference points for fisheries management in addition to other population status indicators within a broad recovery framework.},

The model uses weekly data from 19 seasons to estimate annual recruitment and female spawners emigration out of the vulnerable stock to attend to their broods. The matched annual spawners-recruitment (SR) magnitudes are then used as observations in a non-Bayesian hierarchical inference framework. The Shepherd SR model was selected among three alternatives. The stock has a high degree of density-dependence, leading to overcompensation. The estimated SR model has an unstable equilibrium point, driving the stock to deterministic cyclic fluctuations under small disturbances. Under those conditions the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is not applicable, lending further credence to Sidney Holt's opposition to the MSY as a basis for the elaboration of fishery management objectives, with potentially wide relevance to the management of SSF and cephalopod fisheries. We argue that harvest rates based on mean latent productivity, a concept that includes the MSY as a special case, are more adequate and sustainable for fluctuating stocks.},

The fishing operational data are the official monthly records of estimated catch biomass and exact nominal effort of two artisanal fleets from 1995 to 2012. To transform catch in biomass to catch in numbers, a monthly trend in mean weight is estimated from biological compositional data from 2002, 2013 and used to produce predictions of mean weight for every month between 1995 and 2012. Estimates of natural mortality and initial abundance, thirty six fleet-specific abundance parameters, and six fleet-specific fishing operational parameters, are obtained by maximum likelihood. Thirty six additional timing parameters are fixed by graphical display of catch spikes, a convenient statistic defined here, and by maximum likelihood. The reconstructed history of the stock shows that the catch varies in direct relation to the magnitude of recruitment pulses, while nominal effort has been stable. The annual exploitation rate was estimated at approximately 10\%, which implies that fishing is occurring at sustainable levels, although these results are conditional on a well-behaved mean monthly weight in the catch and simplified statistical models.},

A shortcoming of these models is that although they estimate vulnerable abundance they do not provide direct information on the productivity of the stocks. Here we combine generalized depletion models with a biomass dynamic model of the Pella--Tomlinson type. The inference framework is hierarchical, with initial biomass estimates from generalized depletion models being used as input to the biomass dynamic model to estimate its hyper-parameters. Two hierarchical inference approaches are employed: the standard state-space framework and a new hybrid marginal-estimated approximation to the likelihood function, which make different simplifying assumptions. We apply this assessment approach to the first Chilean fishery with a Management Plan, the southern sea urchin fishery. Results from both hierarchical inference methods show a stock fluctuating between high and low biomass levels, for which maximum sustainable yield appears as a risk-prone annual harvest policy. Given this we propose an alternative annual harvest rate corresponding to the average latent productivity over the years of peaks and troughs of biomass fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Across the NE Atlantic, the category ``gurnards'' may include as many as 8 different species. However, ICES landing statistics are not discriminated to species level. In Portugal, ``tub gurnard'' is the only species reported since 2000. The market sampling of the Data Collection Framework is the only reliable source of data for the definition of allocation keys for species composition in landings. Portuguese DCF market sampling data for the period 2009-2015 in Division IXa was used to estimate the total annual landings by species of gurnards. The influence of variables such as time, space and m{\'e}tier was assessed to derive the best species allocation key to re-construct the time series of landings by species. Based on this analysis, we discuss the implications for the current Portuguese market concurrent sampling of accommodating a sampling design aiming at estimating the species composition in landings of such unsorted categories.},

  abstract = {In a period when the Iberian sardine stock abundance is at its historical minimum, knowledge of the sardine juvenile's distribution is crucial for the development of fishery management strategies. Generalized additive models were used to relate juvenile sardine presence with geographical variables and spawning grounds (egg abundance) and to model juvenile abundance with the concurrent environmental conditions. Three core areas of juvenile distribution were identified: the Northern Portuguese shelf (centred off Aveiro), the coastal region in the vicinity of the Tagus estuary, and the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. Spatial differences in the relationship between juvenile presence and egg abundances suggest that essential juvenile habitat might partially differ from the prevailing spawning grounds. Models also depicted significant relationships between juvenile abundance, temperature and geographical variables in combination with salinity in the west and with zooplankton in the south. Results indicate that the sardine juvenile distribution along the Iberian Peninsula waters are an outcome of a combination of dynamic processes occurring early in life, such as egg and larva retention, reduced mortality and favourable feeding grounds for both larvae and juveniles.},

Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Bight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limandu limanda were abundant. In the Channel and to the west of the UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially poor cod Z'risopterus minutus, solenette Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the lesser weever, Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen Aatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Platfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes ({\textasciitilde}30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two fauna1 types. The additional influence on demersal populations of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion.

  abstract = {We review studies claiming that fish feel pain and find deficiencies in the methods used for pain identification, particularly for distinguishing unconscious detection of injurious stimuli (nociception) from conscious pain. Results were also frequently misinterpreted and not replicable, so claims that fish feel pain remain unsubstantiated. Comparable problems exist in studies of invertebrates. In contrast, an extensive literature involving surgeries with fishes shows normal feeding and activity immediately or soon after surgery. C fiber nociceptors, the most prevalent type in mammals and responsible for excruciating pain in humans, are rare in teleosts and absent in elasmobranchs studied to date. A-delta nociceptors, not yet found in elasmobranchs, but relatively common in teleosts, likely serve rapid, less noxious injury signaling, triggering escape and avoidance responses. Clearly, fishes have survived well without the full range of nociception typical of humans or other mammals, a circumstance according well with the absence of the specialized cortical regions necessary for pain in humans. We evaluate recent claims for consciousness in fishes, but find these claims lack adequate supporting evidence, neurological feasibility, or the likelihood that consciousness would be adaptive. Even if fishes were conscious, it is unwarranted to assume that they possess a human-like capacity for pain. Overall, the behavioral and neurobiological evidence reviewed shows fish responses to nociceptive stimuli are limited and fishes are unlikely to experience pain.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based fishery management (EBFM) is based on a holistic approach, recognising all the interactions within an ecosystem rather than considering single species or issues in isolation. Studies of catch profiles of target and bycatch species for different fleets and metiers are necessary for successful management of target species. Such studies are also needed for the assessment of the interactions and evaluation of the impact on the eco\- systems. This paper presents a study of the Spanish purse-seine fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay during the years 2016--2019. It considers the species selectivity and the effect of fishing activities on the pelagic community by assessing the interactions with the endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species and estimating the discard sizes. For the purpose of this study, the metiers were defined by grouping similar catch profiles, using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. This definition of metier goes beyond the Data Collection Framework (DCF) concepts; it includes specific target species, thus increasing the accuracy. Sampling conducted at sea during the four years of the study demonstrated that; 1) the discards were scarce both in terms of overall values and the proportion of the catch (below 1\% for almost all metiers and years); 2) The studied purse-seine fishery is one of the most selective among those harvesting the pelagic domain in the Bay of Biscay; 3) The results also showed that the fleet avoided the unwanted catches, mostly by practising slipping;4) The interaction with the ETPs was almost non-existent. Only a single case of a yellow-legged gull entanglement was recorded, and the bird was released alive. Notably, more than 7500 individuals of 16 species of seabirds and marine mammals were recorded in the vicinity of the fishing grounds. Thus, we conclude that this purse-seine fishery has only a slight impact on the main species of the pelagic ecosystem, due to the purse-seine slipping practices.},

Scanned images of whole and cross-sectioned otoliths from bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, warmouth L. gulosus, and white crappie Pomoxis annularis provided adequate resolution for visualizing and counting annuli as well as for measuring interannual growth increments. I found concordant relationships between interannual growth measurements taken with a microscope-based image analysis system and those taken with the scanning technique. The use of flatbed scanners for age and growth analyses could substantially reduce costs, and such scanners may already be available for many persons interested in otolith image analysis. This could widen the access to otolith research for those who previously could not afford imaging equipment. Depending on user experience and computer and scanner speeds, 25--40 already cross-sectioned or whole otoliths can be digitized per hour into high-quality photographs, a process rate that is comparable with that of contemporary image analysis systems.},

  abstract = {Extensions of single-species stock assessments to include ecosystem considerations are one step towards achieving an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. While red tide mortality has been estimated within base assessment models for both gag grouper and red grouper in the Gulf of Mexico since the late 2000 s, considerable uncertainty remains regarding how best to incorporate this source of mortality in stock assessment and the potential risks of misspecifying its timing and its effect across age-classes. We conduct simulation testing of an approach to estimating red tide mortality, which treats red tide as a bycatch fleet where all encountered fish are discarded dead. Accounting for episodic natural mortality events by correctly specifying the years in which these events occurred was the most unbiased and precise approach for estimating population quantities, although the estimated red tide mortalities were highly variable in magnitude. While not estimating red tide mortality provided reasonably unbiased estimates of terminal biomass and fishing mortality rate, which are used to determine stock status, caution must be exercised when red tide events occur in the terminal year(s), as ignoring episodic mortality can lead to these events being misinterpreted in model fitting and inflating estimates of fishing mortality (and potentially overfishing status). Our simulations highlight the importance of continued data collection on how red tides affect marine resources, and continued community and stakeholder engagements to gain an understanding of the historical timing and impact of red tide events.},

However, methods and models based on vessel tracking data are mostly devised to be applied to towed gears, whereas applications to multi-gear and passive fisheries have been underrepresented. Here, we propose a methodology to deal with geospatial data to map and quantify the fishing effort, as soak time, of passive fishing gears used by a multi-gear fishing fleet. This approach can be adapted to other passive multi-or single-gear fisheries, since it requires only three variables that can be extracted from a pre-classified dataset, to identify the beginning (gear deployment) and the end (hauling) of passive fishing events. As far as we are aware, this is the first time a methodology that allows quantifying the soak time of static passive fishing events, within a polyvalent fishery context, is presented. We argue that the information that can be extracted from such approaches could contribute to improved management of multi-gear and static-gear fisheries and the ecosystem-based approach.},

  abstract = {Recruitment variability is an important component of the dynamics of Iberian sardine (Sardine pilchardus). Since 2006, poor recruitment has led to a decrease in stock biomass, the latest in a series of such crises for sardine fisheries. Understanding the mechanisms behind recruitment fluctuations has been the objective of many previous studies, and various relationships between recruitment and environmental variables have been proposed. However, such studies face several analytical challenges, including short time-series and autocorrelated data. A new analysis of empirical relationships with environmental series is presented, using statistical methods designed to cope with these issues, including dynamic factor analysis, generalized additive models, and mixed models. Relationships are identified between recruitment and global (number of sunspots), regional (NAOAutumn), and local [winter wind strength, sea surface temperature (SST), and upwelling] environmental variables. Separating these series into trend and noise components permitted further investigation of the nature of the relationships. Whereas the other three environmental variables were related to the trend in recruitment, SST was related to residual variation around the trend, providing stronger evidence for a causal link, possible mechanisms for which are discussed. After the removal of trend and cyclic components, residual variation in recruitment is also weakly related to the previous year's spawning-stock biomass.},

Measurements were taken during a 2-week period of an `upwelling-favourable' wind event. An offshore displacement of the surface low salinity Western Iberia Buoyant Plume (WIBP) was observed well off the shelf break. Below the plume, the current was southward over the mid- and inner-shelf. Offshore, the flow was poleward in the northern part of the survey area and equatorward in the south. A convergence zone was detected along the outer shelf and upper slope where the buoyant plume was apparently trapped and deepened. In general, eggs and larvae were distributed according to the spreading of the low salinity surface waters, and also within the convergent band. Older larvae were retained within the latter feature. The role of wind forcing on the plume and its interaction with the slope flow were analysed. A mechanism of larvae retention was formulated based on simplified models of the observed shelf-slope circulation.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that coastal and shelf cephalopod populations have increased globally over the last six decades. Although cephalopod landings are dominated by the squid fishery, which represents nearly 80\% of the worldwide cephalopod catches, octopuses and cuttlefishes represent \$10\% each. Total reported global production of octopuses over the past three decades indicates a relatively steady increase in catch, almost doubling from 179,042 t in 1980 to 355,239 t in 2014. Octopus fisheries are likely to continue to grow in importance and magnitude as many finfish stocks are either fully or over-exploited. More than twenty described octopus species are harvested from some 90 countries worldwide. The current review describes the major octopus fisheries around the globe, providing an overview of species targeted, ecological and biological features of exploited stocks, catches and the key aspects of management.},

Four mesh sizes were tested: 53, 62.5, 70 and 82 mm. Horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), hake and tub gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucerna) dominated the catches, from a minimum of 89\% (82 mm mesh) to a maximum of 97.8\% (70 mm) of the biomass caught. Efficiency of the four meshes was not significantly different with respect to the total hake catches. Selectivity on M. merluccius was assessed by Sechin and SELECT methods. Tangling was an important catch modality for hake, as evidenced by the results of the Sechin model which described only the first mode of the size distributions corresponding to the entangled specimens. SELECT showed that the bi-modal function gave the best adjustment to the length-frequency distributions; the modal catch sizes were 33, 39.2, 43.6 and 51 cm total length respectively for the 53, 62.5, 70 and 82 mm mesh sizes. Taking into account the size of first maturity for females (35.1 cm TL), 62.5 mm is the most adequate mesh for exploiting hake as it gives some protection to both immature specimens and large females.},

  abstract = {Seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in estuarine and coastal migrations of anadromous fish species have important consequences to their survival, growth, recruitment, and reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that otolith (sagitta) microchemistry can document the environmental history of individual fish across an estuarine salinity gradient. Juvenile striped bass, Morone suxntilis (Walbaum), (80 days posthatch) were reared for 3 wk in aquaria at two temperatures and six salinities. The ratio of strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) deposited in the sagittal otoliths of reared juveniles was positively related to salinity. Temperature and growth rate had relatively minor, but significant effects on the Sr/Ca ratio. In a second experiment, juveniles (80 days posthatch) were exposed to increasing salinity (0 ppt to 25 ppt) and then decreasing salinity (25 ppt to 0 ppt) over a 20-wk period. Electron microprobe examination of the otoliths from these juveniles showed a gradual rise and decline in Sr/Ca during the experimental period which corresponded directly tiith experimental changes in salinity. Field data on subadult and adult striped bass corroborated the laboratory analyses and indicated a logistic relationship between ambient salinity and otolith Sr/Ca ratio. Verification studies support the use of otolith microchemistry to measure migratory schedules and habitat utilization patterns in anadromous striped bass populations.},

  abstract = {Gurnards are a valuable by-catch of mixed demersal fisheries and are commercially important in European waters, but they are often discarded, reported under ``mixed gurnards'' and with incomplete biological information by species. In the present work, a total of 558 piper gurnard specimens of between 10.9 and 44.4 cm (1 to 11 years) and 425 red gurnard specimens of between 10.2 and 42.1 cm (0 to 9 years) from the northeast Atlantic (Portuguese) coast were used to study age and growth. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters for piper gurnard were estimated through the combination of whole-otolith readings and back-calculation (L{$\infty$}=44.7 cm, k=0.16 yr--1 and t0=--2.781 yr). For red gurnard the same growth parameters were estimated using whole-otolith readings (L{$\infty$}=40.2 cm, k=0.28 yr--1 and t0=--1.074 yr). The results indicate that the red gurnard reaches a smaller length, although it grows faster than the piper gurnard. Natural, instantaneous and fishing mortalities were estimated as well as the exploitation rate for both species. For the Portuguese coast, the red gurnard showed a higher fishing mortality and exploitation rate than the piper gurnard, raising concerns about its sustainable management.},

  abstract = {In Portugal, as in most European countries, rays and skates are important commercial resources. Most of their landings are by-catches from fishing fleets targeting other species. Commonly, rays and skates landings are not discriminated by species and their value is simply assigned according to specimens' size. Along years, the Portuguese total ray landings have been relatively uniform, yet this does not necessarily imply that the populations of different species are evenly stable. This study constitutes a first approach to describe and characterize the landings from fishing fleets operating at Peniche - the main Portuguese port on landings of rays and skates. Multivariate statistical methods were used as exploratory tools to identify different Fishing Strategies, defined according to the fishing gear, the season, the main landing species and the commercial size classes of rays and skates not discriminated by species. The information on species composition of rays and skates was further included. Raja brachyura was the most common being mainly caught by vessels using gillnets. R. montagui was mainly caught by longline. Information on the biology indicated that R. montagui reproduces along spring months and the estimated growth rate is higher than R. brachyura, although it attains smaller maximum size.},

The length frequency distribution ranged from 13 to 28 cm of total length and had few individuals smaller than 15 cm (minimum legal size).The impossibility of analysing the length frequency distribution of monthly samples to estimate growth parameters, was due to the scarcity of small specimens and because D. cuneata is a sequencial spawner. A maturation scale was established based on macroscopical and histological observation of gonads. The study of the reprodutive cycle was carried out analysing the temporal evolution of the number of individuals in each maturative stage, gonadossomatic index, hepatossomatic index and condition factor. The wedge sole has a long spawning period, with the most intensity from February to July. The transference of hepatic reserves for reproduction seemed to start in May and finish in June, between April and August the physical condition of individuals had an accentuated downfall. The females seem to reach the sexual maturity near 15 cm (L50 = 14.9 cm).},

We used 1997, 2003, and 2006 tag release-recapture data to estimate the size transition matrix, M, fishing mortality, total selectivity, and retained selectivity and compared M likelihood profiles between both methods. Furthermore, we conducted simulations with varying initial survival and tag reporting rates to show that M estimation reliability declines as these rates decline. Restricted time-at-large, full initial survival, and complete reporting assumptions produce an M estimate closer to that of the integrated length-based assessment method. Because the reliability of the M estimate is sensitive to changes in these assumptions, future efforts should focus on maximizing the number of tagged crab (and hence recaptures), evaluating initial tag-induced mortality, and optimizing tagged crab recapture reporting rates. The reliance of fishery-dependent data and high tag reporting rates highlights the importance for maintaining a positive cooperation with fishers for efforts towards sustainable management.},

The spatial and temporal progress of cohorts was modelled using abundance-at-age survey data by area in the period 2000--2016, covering the region from the northern Bay of Biscay to the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. A novel methodology was used to calculate indices of cohort movement between areas. Movement was relatively low between three large regions, the Bay of Biscay, the northern Spanish and Portuguese waters and the Gulf of Cadiz, each hosting a recruitment hotspot. On the other hand, one half of the sardines recruited in North Portugal and a quarter of those recruited in Southwest Portugal moved to northern Spanish waters and South Portugal, sustaining local populations and fisheries. Movement was mainly driven by recruitment strength and, in a less extent, by food availability during fall. The connectivity and dynamic patterns suggest a metapopulation with three weakly connected populations and density-dependent source-sink movement within the northern Spanish and Portuguese waters population. While the weak connectivity does not invalidate the management boundary between the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Peninsula, the Gulf of Cadiz may be treated as a separate stock. Multi-area/metapopulation assessment approaches should be applied to account for complex population structure, the higher risks of depleting source areas and/or less productive populations.},

  abstract = {Length, Weight and their relationship of marine fish have been gained interest in the context of the ecosystem approach to fisheries and global change. Body conditions are influenced by environmental variability at seasonal and annual scale and are often used to evaluate individual growth patterns and reproductive potential at individual and population levels. Several studies on body condition have been published mainly in Bay of Biscay, English Channel and Mediterranean Sea. These studies showed a decreasing trend in body condition for Small Pelagic Species (SPF) which could impact the fishing and seafood industry sector. In the Atlantic Iberian Area, the sources of variability in fish condition has never been accurately understood or studied. Here, we investigated the variability in body condition and its responses to environmental changes for the main SPF targeted by purse-seine fleet in the Portuguese Coast; Sardine (Sardina pilchardus), Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), Chub mackerel (Scomber colias) and Horse Mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), based on 30 years of morphometric data from both Acoustics scientific surveys and market samples. To evaluate allometric growth, length-weight relationships will be established. Body condition annual and seasonal trends will be modelled taking into account the variability explained by age classes and sex. Also the relative effects of environmental factors and catch levels on the inter annual variability of body condition will be quantified. Finally multivariate relationships among all small pelagic species body condition and exogenous factors will be described to characterize the state of the population and its global environment over the 30 years.},

Building on Results Based Management principles, RFMS involves the definition of specific and measurable objectives for a fishery by the relevant authorities but allows resource users the freedom to find ways to achieve the objectives and to provide adequate documentation. Taking into account the main goals of the new Common Fisheries Policy, such as sustainable utilization of the resources, end of discards and unwanted catches, a management plan for the Portuguese crustacean trawl fishery was developed in cooperation with the fishing industry, following the process and design laid out in the RFMS concept. The plan considers biological, social and economic goals and assigns a responsibility for increased data collection to the resource users. The performance of the plan with regard to selected indicators was evaluated through simulations. In this paper the process towards a RFMS is described and the lessons learnt from the interaction with stakeholders in the development of an alternative management plan are discussed.},

In spite of a substantial decrease in fish catches, little data are available either on the population structure or on the management of the species. In this study, chemical analysis with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of whole otoliths of 90 pouts (age group 2, total length: 17.9--25.0 cm) provided location-specific elemental signatures. Sampling took place in shallow waters along the coastline in three fishing grounds off the Portuguese north coast (Viana do Castelo, Matosinhos and Aveiro) between February and March 2010. Otolith fingerprint analysis detected the presence of several informative trace elements. Molar concentrations for each site were analysed through uni- and multivariate statistical tests. Strontium, barium, magnesium and lithium (Sr, Ba, Mg and Li) differed significantly among locations, while no significant differences were found for manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni). Canonical analysis allowed us to discriminate the tested individuals with respect to their sampling origin with a mean classification accuracy of 69\%. The observed site-specific elemental differences in pout otoliths suggest a high level of site-fidelity in relation to their growing/feeding areas. Pouts from these locations can be regarded as a single, although not necessary homogenous, stock. Furthermore, this study also suggests that the populations of juvenile fish mix partially and, therefore, cannot be assumed to be separate units for fisheries management purposes.},

The present study aims to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of sardine (               Sardina pilchardus               , Walbaum 1792) in the Portuguese continental waters, relating the spatiotemporal variability of biomass index with the environmental conditions. Acoustic data was collected during Portuguese spring acoustic surveys (PELAGO) over a total of 16,370 hauls from 2000 to 2020 (gap in 2012).

  abstract = {This study describes broad-scale spatial variations in sardine growth across the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean waters using opportunistic samples collected in recent years. More detailed information on spatial, decadal and seasonal growth variations is provided for the Iberian-Biscay region using data collected in acoustic surveys since the mid-1980s. Growth curves are fitted to annual or monthly length-at-age data using a robust Von Bertalanffy model; parameters for recent samples are compared with literature information using an auximetric plot while differences between areas within the Iberian-Biscay region are tested by log-likelihood ratio tests. Sardine growth performance is generally lower in the Mediterranean and declines across the northeastern Atlantic from the English Channel to north Morocco but increases sharply off Mauritania. Lower growth of Mediterranean sardines is possibly associated to the overall oligotrophy of this Sea while differentiation from the Atlantic is likely sustained by reproductive isolation between populations from the two areas. Within the northeastern Atlantic, size- and age related migrations may partly explain differences in maximum length/age and mean length-at-age between neighbouring areas but the broad-scale latitudinal decline in growth is consistent with adaptation to the north--south decline in seasonal temperature gradients and to the annual cycles of plankton production. Within the Atlantic Iberian waters, sardine grows and improves in condition during spring and summer when the allocation of energetic resources for gonad development cease, temperature is close to the annual maxima and plankton production is high. Variation in sardine length-at-age and growth within the Atlanto-Iberian stock area has implications for stock structure and needs to be taken into account in the calculation of weight and maturity-at-age for assessment purposes. No evidence of broad temporal changes in sardine growth within the Iberian-Biscay region is obtained.},

Maturity ogives were fitted to maturity-at-length data using Generalized Linear Models, and maturation patterns are summarized by length at first maturity (L50). Sardine attain sexual maturity at a total length of 10.9--16.8 cm. The percentage of mature small sardine increases from north to south across the Northeast Atlantic. L50 is low in the Mediterranean and Moroccan waters, but maturation is delayed towards the limits of the species' range. Sardine mature smaller in the Gulf of Cadiz than in other areas of the Atlanto-Iberian stock, although there is no indication of a different maturation pattern north of the stock boundary. These results are not sufficient to review the stock structure of sardine, but question the hypothesis of homogeneous biological properties of sardine populations within the stock area. Sardine maturation length reduced and the spawning period extended in western Iberia during the past two decades. Associated increases in fish condition and fat reserves during the summer feeding season suggest that variations in reproductive traits may have been caused by environmentally driven changes in food availability.},

Twenty-four years of age-at-harvest data for black-tailed deer (               Odocoileus hemionus               ) were analyzed to produce abundance estimates ranging from 1,281 adult females to 3,232 adult females on a 22,079-ha tree farm in Pierce County, Washington, USA. The annual natural survival probability was estimated to be 0.7293 (                              = 0.0097) for this female population. The estimated abundance was highly correlated with an independent browse damage index (               r               = 0.8131,               P {$<$}               0.001). A population reconstruction incorporating the browse index did not substantially improve the model fit but did provide an auxiliary model for predicting deer abundance. This population reconstruction illustrates a cost-effective alternative to expensive big game survey methods.},

  abstract = {Statistical population reconstruction can be a valuable tool for monitoring the status and trends of game populations at large spatial scales using age-at-harvest data. Despite their utility and increasing use in demographic studies, it is necessary that these models be evaluated before their results are applied. We recommend practitioners evaluate their fitted population models using a variety of approaches, including residual analyses, point-deletion techniques and sensitivity analyses, and we illustrate these techniques using several case studies. Although we stress the value of these quantitative procedures, the final evaluation criterion should be the biological realism of the estimated demographic parameters and trends. Auxiliary field data should be used whenever possible in this final model check. After investigators are satisfied that the selected model(s) is/are adequate, this auxiliary data can be incorporated in a final stage of the analyses to further improve accuracy and precision of the population projections. The procedures we outline and recommendations we make will improve the credibility and utility of results of population reconstruction modeling.},

It was also the first Cestoda species recorded in tub gurnard. However, as shown in our study, the identification of complex species such as Bothriocephalus scorpii based only on external characteristics had to be supplemented with molecular marker analysis to determine the taxonomic status of the specimen. Therefore, to successfully identify the parasite specimen, DNA was extracted from it, and a partial sequence of lsrDNA was amplified and the PCR product was subjected to 2 {\texttimes} 300 bp PE sequencing with 10,000{\texttimes} coverage on MiSeq. A BLAST search using the 346 bp sequence showed 100\% similarity to the lsrDNA sequence of B. scorpii deposited in GenBank under accession number AF286942. Relatedness between the sequence of B. scorpii found in our study and the 20 most similar records from GenBank was identified using a phylogenetic tree constructed under maximum likelihood. Our study proves that next-generation sequencing of partial lsrDNA supplemented the morphological identification of the parasite specimen and can be applied in future parasitological studies.},

Spawning-stock biomass (SSB), recruitment (R), and production (R/SSB) data for the years 1978 -- 2006 are analysed in relation to the upwelling index (UPW) and sea surface temperature (SST). The population oscillates in two relatively stable orbits (identified by multiresolution decomposition of the recruitment series) because the external forcing (UPW and SST) are the inverse of each other and the synchrony is lost between the two external variables, R and R/ SSB as they shift towards steep, negative (depensatory) trends. Such mechanics may have induced recruitment failures and significant decreases in abundance of Iberian sardine. The relationships are assumed to validate a complex and dynamic continuum (multiple orbits of stability) and an alternative variable-carrying-capacity population model. Radial systems with two orbits of stability are proposed for the R/SSB and S/SSB (where S is the stock size) relationships. Results are discussed in relation to classical and alternative SR models to address stock rehabilitation and fishing mortality issues as the population shifts towards low recruitment and abundance, and critical factors to consider in developing exploitation strategies for systems with multiple orbits of stability are discussed.},

Despite the large fluctuations in the octopus abundance series, results showed a strong aggregation pattern for the last 3 months of the year, possibly related to the input of new recruits to the fishery. The calculated common trend for the 12 months time-series presented significant correlations with autumn rainfall of the previous year (lag - 1), particularly for the October, November, and December series. Other important correlations were found for the Western Mediterranean Oscillation index (lag - 1), Ekman transport, summer river run-off (lag - 1), horizontal and vertical component of windstress, among others. The main trend describes a moderate steady increase in LPUE during the last 10 years, suggesting that octopus abundance has increased from 1990 to 2010. The strong correlations of the monthly octopus LPUE series, together with the annual life cycle, suggest that after environmentally controlled recruitment, population dynamics is largely fishery driven, resulting in strong seasonality in the landings.},

The common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) pot and trap fishery in the Algarve (Portugal) holds the potential for implementation of a co-management system. To explore this potential, seven participatory workshops took place between 2014--2015, bringing together 60 participants from 10 fishing associations and 16 fisheries management and research institutions. The exercise resulted in promising outcomes with regards to the possible implementation of a co-management system for the fishery. In the present work an overview of the outcomes of the participatory workshops is given and compared with initiatives worldwide. Among the management actions identified, some have direct impacts on the octopus' life cycle, while all target the same overall objective: to regulate fishing effort. In the informal setting of the workshops, a formal request was developed: the establishment of an annual closed season in the Algarve. This request was taken into consideration by the responsible management institution.},

Often, catches and fishing effort are underestimated and discards are ignored. This results in biased estimates of stock status and reference points. Therefore, we conduct a sensitivity analysis for different under-reporting scenarios (due to non-declared landings, by-catch, and discards) on model estimates and thus advice for the black hake species in northwest Africa. Two modelling frameworks were used, namely a stochastic SPM in continuous time (SPiCT) and Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment (JABBA). A common set of diagnostics was developed to allow comparison across modelling frameworks. Scenarios correspond to hypotheses about misreporting and assumptions and priors that were kept consistent. The ratio of current fishing mortality over the fishing pressure that gives the maximum sustainable yield, F/FMSY, is most affected by under-reporting. Results are sensitive to the prior assumed for the initial depletion level, B0/K, and research is needed. If the misreporting is changing over time, relative quantities (e.g. F/FMSY) and trends are biased, while if misreporting (or at least a part of misreporting) is constant, relative quantities are unbiased. Therefore, the nature of any trend in misreporting should be investigated.},

In each area, we conducted, in 1999--2000, seasonal, experimental fishing trials at various depths with trammel nets of six different inner/outer panel mesh combinations (i.e., two large outer panel meshes and three small inner panel meshes). Overall, our study covered some of the most commonly used inner panel mesh sizes, ranging from 40 to 140 mm (stretched). We analysed the species composition and catch rates of the different inner/outer panel combinations with regression, multivariate analysis (cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling) and other `community' techniques (number of species, dominance curves). All our analyses indicated that the outer panel mesh sizes used in the present study did not significantly affect the catch characteristics in terms of number of species, catch rates and species composition. Multivariate analyses and seasonal dominance plots indicated that in Basque, Algarve and Cyclades waters, where sampling covered wide depth ranges, both season and depth strongly affected catch species compositions. For the Gulf of Ca{\textasciiacute}diz, where sampling was restricted to depths 10--30 m, season was the only factor affecting catch species composition and thus group formation. In contrast, the inner panel mesh size did not generally affect multidimensional group formation in all areas but affected the dominance of the species caught in the Algarve and the Gulf of Ca{\textasciiacute}diz. Multivariate analyses also revealed 11 different me{\textasciiacute}tiers (i.e., season--depth--species--inner panel mesh size combinations) in the four areas. This clearly indicated the existence of trammel net `hot spots', which represent essential habitats (e.g., spawning, nursery or wintering grounds) of the life history of the targeted and associated species. The number of specimens caught declined significantly with inner panel mesh size in all areas. We attributed this to the exponential decline in abundance with size, both within- and between-species. In contrast, the number of species caught in each area was not related to the inner mesh size. This was unexpected and might be a consequence of the wide size-selective range of trammel nets.},

The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0.80 mg g{\`A}1) and starry ray (0.75 mg g{\`A}1). Forkbeard (0.67 mg g{\`A}1), frostfish (0.59 mg g{\`A}1) and striped mullet (0.55 mg g{\`A}1) showed slightly lower levels, while red gurnard (0.33 mg g{\`A}1) and yellow gurnard (0.22 mg g{\`A}1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of linear regression analysis showed a significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leads to an increase in the exposure level for consumers. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to enable them to make decisions about eating fish.},

  abstract = {The geographic variability in otolith shape of horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) was investigated as a tool for stock separation. The outlines of several thousand otoliths, collected in 20 sampling areas during two consecutive years and covering most of the distributional range of the species in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, were digitised and analysed for shape variation by elliptical Fourier analysis. Only fish of a medium total length (20--35 cm) were included in the data analysis to minimise size effects between areas. The extracted Fourier descriptors were corrected for fish size preceding multivariate analysis. Multidimensional scaling of the average Fourier descriptors by area, combining both sampling years, showed three distinct clusters of areas: a northern, an Ibero-Mauritanian and an eastern Mediterranean group. These patterns were supported by discriminant analysis of the individual Fourier descriptors, with correct classifications ranging from 31 to 95\%. Similar groups could be observed when analysing the two sampling years separately. The discrimination between these groups was 81--88\%, while individuals from the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean were correctly classified by around 88--91\%. Average otolith shapes for these groups showed characteristic differences, especially in the dorsal part of the otolith outline. The results of this study indicate that the separation line between the western and the southern stock should be shifted to the coast of southern Galicia (Cape Finisterre). In contrast to previous genetic and morphometric studies, the observed variation in otolith shapes could not confirm a separation of a western horse mackerel stock from the North Sea stock. Further, fish from the areas around the Iberian Peninsula (including the western Mediterranean) appear to be very similar to the northwest African occurrences. By integration of the inferred information on stock structure into a currently pursued multidisciplinary approach to stock identification of horse mackerel, the stock-adaptive assessment and sustainable management of horse mackerel in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean will be significantly improved.},

  abstract = {Surface water samples were collected before, during and after purse seining for sardine off northern Portugal (12 sets) to test the hypothesis that fishing can lead to changes in local nutrient concentrations. Ammonia, urea, residual organic nitrogen and phosphate concentrations significantly increased during fishing and the increase was a pulse event associated with the drying-up of the net (when fish density in the net is highest). Concentrations at the end of fishing (on average 40 min after drying-up) were lower than peak values but still significantly higher than the original concentrations. Nitrate and nitrite did not alter during the fishing operation, further suggesting that the observed increase in nitrogen and phosphorus compounds is of biological origin. There was no significant relation between peak concentrations and fish catch, suggesting that the fisheriesassociated stimulus does not affect equally all the fish in the net (relative position in the net and fish condition may influence the probability of release). Published data on sardine nitrogen excretion and observations on nutrient concentrations in sardine body parts indicate that enhanced excretion of nitrogenous waste stimulated from stress reactions could account for the observed increase in ammonia and urea. Skin mucus release from scale loss (occurring extensively during the drying-up) is the most likely source of phosphorus, while forced evacuation of partly digested food items from the intestine or regurgitation from the stomach (both associated with the mechanical pressure and contact among fish and with the net walls at the end of drying-up) probably also contribute to the increase in residual organic nitrogen.},

Our results showed that the Portuguese continental shelf ecosystem model is a good predictor of biomass and catch timeseries trends for many species. Moreover, our results suggested that the main factors that drove the ecosystem dynamics were trophic interactions, fishing and environmental forcing (sea surface temperature). The same drivers were important in explaining sardine decline among which the largest contribution was observed when incorporating sea surface temperature forcing on adult sardine, followed by fishing. Moreover, sardine eggs predators (i.e., chub mackerel, horse mackerel and bogue) were emphasised as the most important among tro\- phic interactions in explaining sardine trend between 1986 and 2017. Furthermore, a flow control hypothesis test, showed that model parametrization allows explaining sardine behaviour through wasp-waist control mechanism, characteristic for upwelling systems. This study represents an important step forward in under\- standing the changes that occurred in the Portuguese continental shelf ecosystem and provides helpful insights to explain Portuguese sardine decline.},

This study demonstrated that the greatest impact on sardine stock is caused by projected SST rise whose effect is dominant and detrimental to sardine stock regardless of other conditions, including sardine fishing at maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). The largest impact on ecosystem stability, maturity and diversity of flows was observed under the forced-biomass scenarios that simulate changes in biomass of sardine predators and competitors. Moreover, these stressors alongside FMSY are projected to play an important role in the future evolution of the sardine stock.

  abstract = {Population dynamics models used to provide management advice for harvested natural resources often estimate population processes that can be mutually confounded. These processes (e.g., natural mortality (M) and catch\- ability (q)) are often assumed to be time-invariant, but this assumption can be violated in real populations. Not allowing for time-variation in these processes can result in retrospective patterns in estimated biomass, which can result in errors in management advice. Allowing for time-variation in these processes can also result in errors in management advice if the estimated time-variation does not reflect the true underlying variation. Here I present a population dynamics model for snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea that tests different combinations of implementation of time-variation in M and q. The North Pacific Fisheries Management Council did not adopt any of the models with time-variation in M or q for management because the estimated variability in M and q was difficult to explain with any known mechanism and management advice differed by nearly an order of magnitude among models. Large differences in management advice underscore the importance of evidence-based ap\- proaches to incorporating time-variation in population processes into stock assessment models.},

At Madeira, a Portuguese archipelago in the eastern Atlantic, they are the target of a year-round purse-seine fishery operating mainly off the south coast of Madeira Island. Landings of this fishery are mostly composed of blue jack mackerel Trachurus picturatus, Atlantic chub mackerel Scomber colias, and small amounts of sardine Sardina pilchardus. A fisheries observation programme was carried out, from October 2016 to December 2017, to quantify discards and slipping. Large differences were detected in the proportion of each species present in the landings and in the gross catches. Large amounts of the caught S. pilchardus (76.6\%), S. colias (42.6\%) and even T. picturatus (14.2\%) were either discarded dead or slipped. Reasons for discarding included small sizes and a low market value obtained in the first sale of these species. The fishing pattern in this region is in striking contrast with that for mainland Portugal, where S. pilchardus is the most valuable small pelagic species, fetching a high market price. The results of this study suggest a need for the introduction of specific measures to promote more effective utilisation of the resources.},

The stomach contents of the gurnard specimens collected in April and September 1996 by bottom trawling were analyzed. The \% frequency of occurrence, \% number and \% weight of prey types in the stomach contents were evaluated. By weight, Mysidacea and Decapoda dominated in the diet of the three species in both seasons, however the Index of Relative Importance, as well as the percentage frequency of occurrence varied. Rock gurnard presented the most diverse diet whereas the diet of large scale and red gurnard were more specialized. High overlap in terms of number was found between rock and large scale gurnard in May. Rock gurnard had the most divers diet in both seasons.},

  abstract = {The basic purpose of fish stock assessment is to provide estimates of the state of the stock to assure, in the long run, the self-sustainability of the stock under exploitation. The three commonly used stock assessment models are reviewed in this paper namely Surplus production model, Empirical model, and Analytical Model. The first model is simpler and considers the stock as a homogenous biomass. It ignores the complexities of age structure and spatial structure and assumes compensatory population growth and provides fishery managers with some important management parameters. Nonetheless, it requires a long time series catch and effort data and assumes stock has stabilized at a current rate of fishing and its ability to accurately describe and predict the dynamics of fish populations depends greatly on the nature of the available data. The second model makes a link between some easily measured characteristic of a water body, such as its area/depth, the conductivity of the water or the mean primary production and an expected yield. However, a major limitation of the Empirical model is that previously observed empirical relationships may break down in situations when conditions change substantially. The third model, on the other hand, requires a detailed description of the stock such as size or age structure of the stock as well as growth and mortality parameters that characterize the population under investigation. As an advantage, this model gives a reliable estimation of yield and biomass of fish that could be exploited sustainably from a given water body. However, such model has been poorly used in developing countries. Since, it is complex, slow, costly and time-consuming. In conclusion, understating the limitation, advantages and applications of each stock assessment model is very important to make a reliable estimate of vigorous fisheries management parameters in order to manage our aquatic resources sustainably.},

  abstract = {Surplus production represents the processes that affect sustainable fishery harvest and is central to the ecology and management of marine fishes. Taxonomy and life history influence the ratio of spawning biomass at maximum sustainable yield to average unfished spawning biomass (SBMSY/SB0), and estimating this ratio for individual stocks is notoriously difficult. We use a database of published landings data and stock assessment biomass estimates and determine that process errors predominate in this data set by fitting a state--space model to data from each stock individually. We then fit multispecies process-error models while treating SBMSY/SB0 as a random effect that varies by taxonomic order and maximum length. The estimated SBMSY/SB0 = 0.40 for all 147 stocks is intermediate between the values assumed by the Fox and the Schaefer models, although Clupeiformes and Perciformes have lower and Gadiformes and Scorpaeniformes have higher SBMSY/SB0 values. Model selection supports the hypothesis that large-bodied fishes for a given taxonomic order have relatively higher SBMSY/SB0. Results can be used to define reference points for data-poor fisheries or as input in emerging assessment methods.},

  abstract = {One important by-product of bird atlases is to provide population estimates to evaluate species conservation status. Unfortunately, large-scale atlas data are nearly always characterized by an uneven sampling effort among sampling units. This prevents from calculating straightforwardly reliable population estimates. We propose a procedure to deal with this unevenness when generating regional population estimates. The Breeding Bird Atlas of Wallonia 2001-2007 (Southern Belgium) was used to illustrate our method. Data were collected according to a grid composed of 508 sampling units. Each unit was assigned to one or several observers who gathered information on species abundance and breeding status according to an unrestricted procedure. In addition, a series of sub-sampling units were surveyed within each sampling unit to collect information according to a standardized procedure. Based on the data collected according to the unrestricted surveys in the sampling units and the corresponding standardized surveys in the sub-sampling units, we calculated three indices representing different aspects of the sampling effort at the sampling unit level. Those indices are not sensitive to the natural disparity in the nature/diversity of the habitats among the sampling units. The indices were then combined into a single score that was used to weight the contribution of each sampling unit to the calculation of the regional population estimates. Depending on the species, the consideration of the unevenness in the sampling effort led to considerable discrepancies in the population estimates.},

  abstract = {Acoustic data from summer echo-surveys in the Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean) were analysed in an effort to better understand the mechanisms related to diel vertical migration and the schooling behaviour of European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in relation to the time of day. Cosine, quadratic and generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to describe the diurnal patterns in the vertical position and the energetic and morphometric characteristics of anchovy schools. The effect of environmental variables on a suite of school descriptors was additionally examined using GAMs. Disruption of schooling at night was followed by school formation just before dawn at shallow layers, usually above the base of thermocline. Schools moved to deeper depths, close to the seabed during daytime and returned close to the surface to disperse after dusk. Surface light intensity and bottom depth explained a significant amount of variability in the vertical position of schools. Higher light intensities urged schools to deeper depths but maximum downward displacement was constrained by sea bottom in coastal waters ({$<$} 80 m). Along with positional changes, diurnal patterns in school shape and packing density were also identified. Morphometric and energetic descriptors were mostly influenced by school altitude (distance from bottom), bottom depth and ambient light intensity. They presented high plasticity that could partly be explained in terms of the trade-off between predator avoidance and feeding success. The effect of schooling behaviour and diel vertical migration should be taken into account in pelagic fish bioenergetic models and in acoustic surveys in respect to sampling design and species discrimination.},

It was found that month, water depth and fishing area affected total and Trachurus spp. catches of the purse seine fishery, with month and water depth alone explaining 77.8\% and 6.4\% respectively of the total variation of the data. Significant interactions observed indicate that the fluctuations in total catches differed by month and fishing area as well as fishing area and water depth.

Results also suggested that generalized linear modelling of the purse seine catches can be used to obtain representative abundance indices by reducing the observed variability. Fishery scientists' onboard observations alongside fish market recordings during the same period confirmed that each fisher has developed an individual decision-making fishing process. Fisher's trip choice behaviour was found to be modulated by several factors, such as distance of fishing grounds from the port, market demands (both in terms of species and market prices), weather conditions, alternative fishing strategies, previously gathered information, economic pressure and personal skills.

Estimates of fishing capacity and capacity utilization may provide helpful tools in designing an effective capacity management plan for Mediterranean fisheries. In this study, the fishing capacity and capacity utilization of eastern Mediterranean purse seiners were assessed using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Estimates were made for individual vessels based on the level of inputs used and outputs produced, relative to other vessels operating under similar conditions. Results indicated similar excess capacity for target species, which is in accordance with how the fishery operated. The 24--40-m fleet segment was found to be more efficient than the 12--24-m fleet segment in terms of landing weights. It was evidenced that purse seiners could have increased their catch during 2000--2005 by approximately 23\% by increasing the variable inputs, for example days fished. Conversely, a fleet of smaller size could have achieved the reported catch. Under the condition that the remaining vessels will be fully utilized, a proportional decrease in the fleet size might seem a rational management measure towards reducing overexploitation and attaining sustainable fisheries in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.},

Estimates of fishing capacity and capacity utilization may provide helpful tools in designing an effective capacity management plan for Mediterranean fisheries. In this study, the fishing capacity and capacity utilization of eastern Mediterranean purse seiners were assessed using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Estimates were made for individual vessels based on the level of inputs used and outputs produced, relative to other vessels operating under similar conditions. Results indicated similar excess capacity for target species, which is in accordance with how the fishery operated. The 24--40-m fleet segment was found to be more efficient than the 12--24-m fleet segment in terms of landing weights. It was evidenced that purse seiners could have increased their catch during 2000--2005 by approximately 23\% by increasing the variable inputs, for example days fished. Conversely, a fleet of smaller size could have achieved the reported catch. Under the condition that the remaining vessels will be fully utilized, a proportional decrease in the fleet size might seem a rational management measure towards reducing overexploitation and attaining sustainable fisheries in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.},

Once thought to be a benign process, compared to discarding UWC overboard from the fishing vessel, it is now recognised that ``slipping'' can lead to significant mortality in the released fish if done inappropriately. In this chapter, we examine purse seining and slipping operations, and discuss what drives slipping and potential mitigation measures to reduce slipping mortality. We use three examples of purse seine fisheries for small pelagic species in the North-east Atlantic; from Norway, Portugal and Spain. The ideal solution (identifying and avoiding UWC before the net is set) requires the development of tools to enable fishers to better characterise target schools in terms of key selection criteria, e.g., with respect to species, individual size and catch biomass. Such tools are being developed, based primarily on hydro-acoustic technology. However, some UWC in purse seine catches are inevitable, and operational improvements in slipping practices have been shown to significantly reduce stress and mortality in the released UWC. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges currently facing the implementation of the European Union (EU) Landing Obligation with regards to minimising slipping related mortality.},

The principle is that an anthropogenic disturbance in the "impact" location will cause a different pattern of change from before to after it starts compared with natural change in the control location. This can be detectable efficiently as a statistical interaction in an analysis of variance of the data. Usually, samples are taken at replicated, random intervals of time before and after the putative impact starts; this ensures that chance temporal fluctuations in either location do not confound the detection of an impact. These designs are, however, insufficient because any location-specific temporal difference that occurs between the two locations will be interpreted as an impact even if it has nothing to do with the human disturbance. Alternatively, abundance in the single control location may change in the same direction, cancelling the effects of an impact. Here, asymmetrical designs are developed that compare the temporal change in a potentially impacted location with those in a randomly-selected set of control locations. An impact must cause a different temporal change in the disturbed location from what would be expected in similar locations. This can be detected for short-term (pulse) or long-term (press) impacts by different patterns of significance in the temporal interactions between time{\textasciitilde} of sampling and locations. From these novel designs, tests are derived that demonstrate whether an unusual pattern of temporal change in abundance of organisms is specific to the supposedly impacted location and correlated with the onset of the disturbance. Examples are presented of how to use these designs to detect impacts at different spatial scales. Other aspects of their use are discussed.},

C. lucerna samples were collected from the Black Sea, Marmara, Aegean and northeastern Mediterranean coasts of Turkey. The lowest genetic diversity was found in the northeastern Mediterranean (Iskenderun Bay) population, while the highest was in the Marmara population with overall average value of genetic diversity within populations. A total of 14 haplotypes was found, and the highest haplotype diversity was in the Black Sea whereas the lowest was in the northeastern Mediterranean population (Iskenderun Bay). The Black Sea and Iskenderun Bay populations showed the least genetic divergence (0.001081), while the highest was between the Marmara Sea and northeastern Mediterranean (Antalya Bay) populations (0.002067). Pairwise comparisons of genetic distance revealed statistically significant differences (P {$<$} 0.05) between the Marmara and both the Aegean and northeastern Mediterranean (Antalya Bay) samples. Neighbour joining tree analyses clustered the northeastern Mediterranean populations (Antalya Bay and Iskenderun Bay) as genetically more interrelated populations, whereas the Aegean Sea population was clustered as most isolated one. Discriminant function analysis of morphological characters showed that only the Black Sea population is differentiated from the other populations.},

  abstract = {Time series of European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) landings from 1962 and environmental variables from 1978 in the northern Alboran Sea are analysed. European sardine spawns in the northern Alboran Sea from mid-autumn to late winter at a temperature range slightly higher than the one observed in the nearby Eastern North Atlantic and the North Western Mediterranean. Individuals hatched during autumn and winter are incorporated to the fishery during the following summer and autumn producing the maximum annual landings. These landings show both a decreasing long-term trend and a strong inter-annual variability. Although further research is needed, the warming trend of sea surface temperature and the decrease in upwelling intensity inferred from empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses could have some influence on the negative trends of sardine landings. The inter-annual variability of sardine abundance seems to be related to the wind intensity at a local scale, the second principal component of the chlorophyll concentration and the sardine abundance during the preceding year. If the inter-annual variability is considered, a linear model including these three variables with a one-year time lag allows to explain 79\% of the sardine landings variance. If the negative linear trend is also considered, the model explains 86\% of the variance. These results indicate that the body condition of spawners, linked to the food availability during the preceding year, is the main factor controlling the recruitment success. The possibility of predicting sardine landings 1 year in advance could have important implications for fishery management.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates a range of constant harvest rate, constant escapement, and effort control strategies in the purse seine {\textregistered}shery for the Brazilian sardine by accounting for uncertainties in the processes controlling recruitment and catchability. Control strategies are evaluated with a delay-difference simulation model representing three hypotheses about sardine stock{\textpm}recruitment relationship, involving the effect of spawning stock size, depensation and cyclic environmental regimes. Strategies are compared by the predicted average catches, catch variability, and probability of stock collapse. Results from simulations are also used to evaluate the relative merits of different types of policies and to evaluate the relative values of reducing the uncertainties about sardine recruitment dynamics. Better understanding of the processes controlling recruitment is mostly needed if the {\textregistered}shery is to continue being managed by effort control. Constant harvest rate policies provide better trade-off among the performance indicators and appears more robust to uncertainties on the prevailing ecological processes controlling recruitment. Results from this analysis are used to discuss the type of research that would most likely provide the information needed to improve the quality of decisions in the purse seine {\textregistered}shery.},

A total of 86 fishing surveys involving 6,311 cuttlefish traps were performed between May and September from 2009 to 2014. Bycatch species were caught in 1,037 traps (bycatch catchability rate of 16.4\%), comprising 1576 individuals with an overall weight of 268.3 kg. During the study period, bycatch CPUEs were 12.5 ind./50 traps and 2.1 kg/50 traps, with bycatch rates of 21.1\% by number and 15.9\% by weight. Thirty-four species (89.5\% of bycatch taxa) were discarded at sea, corresponding to discard rates of 19.5\% by number and 11.1\% by weight. The short-snouted seahorse, Hippocampus hippocampus (L.), was the third most abundant bycatch species (11.6\% No.; 0.4\% kg) and the second most discarded (12.6\% No.; 0.6\% kg), being invariably discarded live and undamaged owing its conservation status. This markedly seasonal small-scale trap fishery constitutes a locally important socio-economic activity during spring and summer, characterised by low bycatch and discard rates, complemented by high survival rates of discards.},

Overall, were sampled and analysed 5883 individuals with broad ranges in both mantle length and total weight, with females being significantly larger and heavier than males. In males, females and sexes combined, the W-L relationships were highly significant and the morphometric parameters were highly correlated. Regarding relative growth, males, females and sexes combined displayed negative allometries, reflecting a slower growth rate in total weight than in mantle length during the species ontogeny, being the hypoallometric growth less intense in females than in males. An extensive compilation of analogous data reported throughout the distributional range of S. officinalis (Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea) further confirmed that negative allometries (weaker in females than in males) between specimen size and total weight are a typical feature in this species. The main factors responsible for this hypoallometric growth are analysed and their implications are discussed in terms of the species functional morphology and behavioural ecology.},

Subsequently, a series of improvement actions relating to discard minimization are suggested with the goal of enhancing the performance of the Galician fishing fleet through discard minimization. Discard estimates were constructed individually for the different Galician fisheries by aggregating primary data obtained from a total of 89 fishing vessels and secondary data for those fleets that were not directly sampled. Results showed that roughly 60,250 t of marine organisms were discarded by the Galician fleet in 2008, representing 16.9\% of the total capture. Moreover, an important percentage of these discards were linked mainly to trawling vessels and to a lesser extent, to certain long lining fisheries. Therefore, improved management measures in target stocks should take into account the fact that alternative fishing gears other than trawl nets may reduce the amount of discards for certain species. This estimation may improve the assessment of stocks and help to quantify the damage that discards may have on wild ecosystems.},

We start with the simplest models and show the progression from GLMs to either GAMs or GLMMs. Although this is not a comprehensive review, we emphasise topics relevant to fisheries science such as transformation options, link functions, adding model flexibility through splines, and using random and fixed effects. We finish by discussing the various aspects of these models and their variants, and provide a view on their relative benefits to fisheries research.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the modelling process using generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), especially as they are applied within fisheries research. We describe the essential aspect of model interpretation and construction so as to achieve its correct application. We start with the simplest models and show the progression from GLMs to either GAMs or GLMMs. Although this is not a comprehensive review, we emphasise topics relevant to fisheries science such as transformation options, link functions, adding model flexibility through splines, and using random and fixed effects. We finish by discussing the various aspects of these models and their variants, and provide a view on their relative benefits to fisheries research.},

  abstract = {The status of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the western and central Pacific Ocean is regularly assessed using the integrated catch-at-age model MULTIFAN-CL. The model utilizes catch, fishery-dependent standardized CPUE indices, unstandardized effort, mark-recapture, and length-composition data. We tested the sensitivity of natural mortality estimation to functional forms of M at age, assumptions of tag reporting rate parameters, and modeling decisions that influence the fit to the length composition and tag data. We estimated M at age internal to the tag-integrated spatially-explicit model using a range of parameterizations. Likelihood component profiles for mean natural mortality values, nodes in a cubic spline of M at age, and reporting rate parameters were conducted to determine which data were contributing to the estimation of these parameters. The functional form of M at age did not have a large influence on performance indicators (Frecent/FMSY and SBrecent/SBF=0), but cubic splines proved a parameter efficient method of estimation. Assumed functional forms of selectivity and the fixed growth curve influenced estimates of M at age and had moderate impacts on performance indicators, though the weighting of the length composition data was less influential. Some reporting rate parameters were estimated on the upper bound for all models; changes to assumptions of these parameters impacted performance indicators slightly more than length composition changes, but did not strongly influence M-at-age estimates. Assumptions that affected the amount of tagging data included in the model, such as the mixing period, had a large impact on the performance indicators and shape of M at age, but only moderate changes to mean M estimates. Likelihood profiling showed that both tagging data and length composition data strongly influenced estimates of M at age in this catch-at-length tag-integrated model, but there is conflict among the data sources and tagging programs. Standard errors of M at age were small for most ages, particularly those with numerous tag recaptures, and mean M estimates across tested sensitivity models were mostly consistent. There is some concern that estimates may be biased due to incomplete mixing of tags and other assumption violations, but simulation studies are needed to determine the severity. Research is also recommended on methods to resolve data conflict that may be causing reporting rates estimated on upper bounds and to determine appropriate mixing periods of tagging data.},

Although maturity ogives are usually calculated through macroscopic evaluation of the gonads, histology is generally considered to be more accurate. Here we show that the macroscopic analysis consistently overestimates the proportion of mature females for all age classes in Kattegat cod. The resulting bias showed minimum values for all age classes about a month before the spawning season. Consequently, estimation of the incidence of maturation in females several months before or after the spawning season can only be accurate using histological techniques. Further, the observed bias was used to reconstruct a historical data set of maturity ogives of Kattegat cod. The results showed that female spawning biomass (FSB) might have been overestimated by up to 35\%. However, as histological analysis is considered a laborious procedure, proxies of maturity status were sought. It was indicated that the gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices may serve as robust proxies for discriminating mature females from immature, thus greatly enhancing the accuracy of the macroscopic maturity evaluation of cod gonads when histological analysis is lacking.},

Biweekly samples were collected within a single day in clusters from random collections of the total landed catch derived from different vessels operating in the Northwest Aegean Sea, between July 1996 and June 2000. Total length (TL) was measured for 51.246 individuals. In addition, for a sub-sample of 50 individuals per sampling period, gross body weight and gonad weight were also measured to the nearest 0.1 and 0.01 g respectively. The analysis of the biweekly length-frequencies showed that the dominant length classes ranged between 130 and 160 mm TL. The mean biweekly TL decreased significantly (r=-0.525, P{$<$}0.05) with time during the study period. The same was also true for the maximum TL (r=-0.46, n=77, P{$<$}0.001). In contrast, the exponent b of the length-weight relationship increased significantly (r=0.358, P{$<$}0.05) with time. No relationship was found between the gonadosomatic index and b (r=-0.13, P{$>$}0.05). The parameters of the seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth equation and mortality and exploitation rates, based on monthly length-frequencies, were also estimated. The decline in the mean TL and the increase in the slope b of the length-weight relationship are discussed in relation to the recent increase in the effort expended on sardine populations and within the framework of density-dependent effects on growth.},

Here, we characterize the major secretions and steroidogenic pathways of the female optic gland using mass spectrometry techniques. We find that at least three pathways are mobilized to increase synthesis of select sterol hormones after reproduction. One pathway generates pregnane steroids, known in other animals to support reproduction.12--16 Two other pathways produce 7-dehydrocholesterol and bile acid intermediates, neither of which were previously known to be involved in semelparity. Our results provide insight into invertebrate cholesterol pathways and confirm a remarkable unity of steroid hormone biology in life history processes across Bilateria.},

The LBB-estimated asymptotic length for 2018--2019 was smaller. Optimal lengths at first capture for the later far exceeded average lengths in catches because of a major increase in fishing intensity. Between 1975 and 1977, relative total mortality (               Z               /               K               ) was low, but it increased in the latter two periods, while relative natural mortality (               M               /               K               ) showed a downward trend.

Indeed, by 2018, fishing horsepower increased by nearly four times the optimal level. The analysis suggests that the stock of miter squid has been overfished since the mid-1980s and is now under heavy fishing pressure. To recover the stock, it is imperative to reduce fishing intensity and enforce size-at-first-capture regulations.},

Nor is it much more widely known that the California sardine furnishes by far the largest output of any single fish (494,000,000 pounds for 1930) in the huge fishing industry of this State. Some seasons in Europe the sardine comes in enormous schools and then at other times fails to put in an appearance. A French expression "la crise sardini{\`e}re" (the sardine crisis) conveys the idea that a failure takes on the proportions of a disaster, and such it is to the people who depend upon it almost solely for food and employment. As would be expected much has been written to account for the erratic habits of this fish, which is so vital to the commercial life of our State as well as certain parts of Europe. So in the hope that a collection of all the theories and the facts, both scientific and commercial, might prove of assistance to those interested, this bibliography has been compiled.},

Mixed-effect model analyses of longitudinal records of otoliths and somatic growth collected at the individual level revealed that E. evelynae and E. prochilos produced daily increments on their otoliths for up to two months post-settlement and that the Modified-Fry model provided the most accurate size-at-age estimates despite the presence of age, growth and time-varying growth effects in the dataset. Very large errors in predicted size were produced by the Age-Effects model. The four other back-calculation models all provided slightly biased estimates of back-calculated size-at-age, with the Modified-Fry model providing the least biased estimates. Regardless of bias, both experimental and theoretical evidence indicated that back-calculated size was a better proxy of fish length than otoliths radius. Relationships between fish length and otoliths radius were allometric at the level of individuals, which explained why the Modified-Fry model performed better. However, this allometry was undetectable at the population level. This study represents the first attempt to validate modern backcalculation models using longitudinal data collected and analysed at the individual level. Our results suggest the use of the Modified-Fry model as a conservative approach in routine back-calculations of fish size at age from otoliths.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new, open-source modelling software entitled `Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment' (JABBA). JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billfishes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or PellaTomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modified by the global scientific community.},

  abstract = {Age-structured production models (ASPMs) are often preferred over biomass aggregated surplus production models (SPMs) as the former can track the propagation of cohorts and explicitly account for the effects of selective fishing, even in the absence of reliable size- or age data. Here, we introduce `JABBA-Select', an extension of the JABBA software (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment; Winker et al., 2018), that is able to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SPMs and allows a direct comparison to ASPMs. JABBA-Select incorporates life history parameters and fishing selectivity and distinguishes between exploitable biomass (used to fit indices given fishery selectivity) and spawning biomass (used to predict surplus production). Applying JABBA-Select involves using an age-structured equilibrium model to convert the input parameters into multivariate normal priors for surplus-production productivity parameters. We illustrate the main elements of JABBA-Select using the stock parameters of South African silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus, Scienidae) as a case study. This species is exploited by multiple fisheries and was selected as an example of a data moderate fishery that features strong contrast in selectivity over time and across fleets. For proof-of-concept, we use an age-structured simulation framework to compare the performance of JABBA-Select to: 1) a conventional Bayesian state-space model using a Pella-Tomlinson (PT) production function, 2) an ASPM with deterministic recruitment; and 3) an ASPM with stochastic recruitment. The PT model produced biased estimates of relative and absolute spawning biomass trajectories and associated reference points, which by contrast could be fairly accurately estimated by JABBA-Select. JABBA-Select performed at least as well as the ASPMs in accuracy for most of the performance metrics and best characterized the stock status uncertainty. The results indicate that JABBA-Select is able to accurately account for moderate changes in selectivity and fleet dynamics over time and to provide a robust tool for data-moderate stock assessments.},

The impact of codend-related changes (mesh size and shape) and the introduction of a sorting device (sorting grid system) on the main target crustacean species (deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus) and the main fish bycatch species (blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus, and European hake Merluccius merluccius) were evaluated. Horse mackerel was the only fish species for which changing codends negatively affected landings per unit of effort by large percentages. The use of a sorting grid system, only evaluated for blue whiting and Norway lobster, led to a strong decrease in landings per unit of effort, especially for the former species. The impact of gear alterations was negligible on fish spawning-stock biomass, but was significant for crustaceans, particularly rose shrimp. A straightforward evaluation of the economic impact (fishers' revenues) of the three bycatch reduction options showed these to be negligible or small.},

  abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton--Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  abstract = {Power-law relationships are among the most well-studied functional relationships in biology. Recently the common practice of fitting power laws using linear regression (LR) on log-transformed data has been criticized, calling into question the conclusions of hundreds of studies. It has been suggested that nonlinear regression (NLR) is preferable, but no rigorous comparison of these two methods has been conducted. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the error distribution determines which method performs better, with NLR better characterizing data with additive, homoscedastic, normal error and LR better characterizing data with multiplicative, heteroscedastic, lognormal error. Analysis of 471 biological power laws shows that both forms of error occur in nature. While previous analyses based on log-transformation appear to be generally valid, future analyses should choose methods based on a combination of biological plausibility and analysis of the error distribution. We provide detailed guidelines and associated computer code for doing so, including a model averaging approach for cases where the error structure is uncertain.},

The large and heavy otolith may be better suited in saccules of the bottom and reef fishes. The quantities of iron in lagenar otoliths were found to be lower than those of birds. The function of the fish lagena remains to be elucidated by further studies. Objective. To evaluate the morphological characteristics and the chemical composition of the otoliths in fishes as related to behaviour and habitat. Materials and methods. We studied the morphology of the otoliths of 18 genera of fishes (81 samples) divided into 3 groups: saltwater fish (13 genera), freshwater fish except for the carp family (3 genera) and carp family fish (2 genera). The otoliths and the living environments were compared. The chemical composition was analysed using a synchrotron X-ray fluorescence analyser. Results. Bottom fishes generally have larger saccular otoliths, and migrating fishes have smaller saccular otoliths. In comparing the bottom/reef fishes and the migrating fishes in salt water, the former tended to have larger saccular otoliths. In saltwater bottom fishes the tendency was found that the thinner the head, the larger was the saccular otolith. We found significant quantities of iron, zinc and manganese in the lagenar otoliths.},

We also demonstrate the utility of KBPMs for multispecies management objectives or for estimating maximum sustainable yield reference points without a stock recruitment function, among other worthwhile applications. To do so, we present different uses of KBPMs, illustrating their application on demersal species in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) area, specifically for megrim, white anglerfish and European hake stocks. The proposed analytical approach involved fitting single-species and multispecies KBPMs, conducting retrospective analyses and assessing the effects of environmental variability on SP. The findings show that, in general, stock SP increased after a decline in biomass and SP, except for white anglerfish in the southern area. Megrim stocks are the least productive, while hake and northern anglerfish are the most productive. Retrospective analysis revealed SP shifts in northern hake stock for reasons other than biomass variability. Hence, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), two key climate variability modes in the North Atlantic, were tested for their links to SP, revealing a positive connection between SP and AMO, although further research is necessary. Beyond the specific results of our particular KBPM application, our main conclusion is that KBPMs can serve as a tool complementary to more complex assessment models for resolving unaddressed issues and crosschecking available assessment results.},

  abstract = {As part of the global marine fisheries catch reconstruction project conducted by the Sea Around Us over the last decade, estimates were derived for discards in all major fisheries in the world. The reconstruction process derives conservative but non-\-zero time-\-series estimates for every fisheries component known to exist, and relies on a wide variety of data and information sources and on conservative assumptions to ensure comprehensive and complete time-\-series coverage. Globally, estimated discards increased from under 5 million t/year (t = 1,000 kg) in the early 1950s to a peak of 18.8 million t in 1989, and gradually declined thereafter to levels of the late 1950s of less than 10 million t/year. Thus, estimated discards represented between 10\% and 20\% of total reconstructed catches (reported landings + unreported landings + unreported discards) per year up to the year 2000, after which estimated discards accounted for slightly less than 10\% of total annual catches. Most discards were generated by industrial (i.e. large-\-scale) fisheries. Discarding occurred predominantly in northern Atlantic waters in the earlier decades (1950s--1980s), after which discarding off the West Coast of Africa dominated. More recently, fleets operating in Northwest Pacific and Western Central Pacific waters generated the most discards. In most areas, discards consist essentially of marketable taxa, suggesting a combination of poor fishing practices and poor management procedures is largely responsible for the waste discarding represents. This is important in an era of increasing food security and human nutritional health concerns, especially in developing countries.},

It was first used with their Ryzen series of CPUs in February 2017. The first Zen-based preview system was demonstrated at E3 2016, and first substantially detailed at an event hosted a block away from the Intel Developer Forum 2016. The first Zen-based CPUs, codenamed "Summit Ridge", reached the market in early March 2017, Zen-derived Epyc server processors launched in June 2017 and Zen-based APUs arrived in November 2017.Zen is a clean sheet design that differs from AMD's previous long-standing Bulldozer architecture. Zen-based processors use a 14 nm FinFET process, are reportedly more energy efficient, and can execute significantly more instructions per cycle. SMT has been introduced, allowing each core to run two threads. The cache system has also been redesigned, making the L1 cache write-back. Zen processors use three different sockets: desktop and mobile Ryzen chips use the AM4 socket, bringing DDR4 support; the high-end desktop Zen-based Threadripper chips support quad-channel DDR4 RAM and offer 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes (vs 24 lanes), using the TR4 socket; and Epyc server processors offer 128 PCI 3.0 lanes and octa-channel DDR4 using the SP3 socket. Zen is based on a SoC design. The memory, PCIe, SATA, and USB controllers are incorporated into the same chip(s) as the processor cores. This has advantages in bandwidth and power, at the expense of chip complexity and die area. This SoC design allows the Zen microarchitecture to scale from laptops and small-form factor mini PCs to high-end desktops and servers. By 2020, 260 million Zen cores have already been shipped by AMD.},

  abstract = {In the western and central Pacific Ocean, upper strata waters exhibit highly dynamic oceanographic features under ENSO variability. This has been proved to be responsible for the dynamic change of both abundance and zonal distribution of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). Although causality has been suggested by researchers using physical--biological interaction models, cumulative evidence needs to be obtained and the tenability of assertion needs to be tested from an ecological habitat perspective, based on fisheries data. For purse seine fishery, the use of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as an indication of the abundance is confusing because of technical improvements over the whole exploitation history and unbalanced individual fishing characteristic of vessels. It is particularly interesting to discriminate between habitat characteristics in comparative scenarios of CPUE application. This study identified habitat traits based on a series of oceanographic factors from a global ocean reanalysis model. A comparison was conducted between two habitat models based on unprocessed purse seine CPUE and standardized CPUE considering fishing characteristics. The results suggest that standardized CPUE could model the regular zonal shift of habitat compatible with the observed fishing efforts transfer, and achieved better prediction capacity than unprocessed CPUE. Furthermore, the habitat of skipjack tuna was also characterized and linked with surface and subsurface thermal environment, ocean current, dissolved oxygen, biotic environment, and ENSO variability. The monthly-averaged habitat suitable index, derived from the optimal habitat model prediction, showed a significant linear relationship with the southern oscillation index, which suggested that El Ni{\~n}o episodes eventually provide more preferable habitat for skipjack tuna under ENSO variability.},

Otoliths of 88 adult striped bass collected in 1994 and 1995 were analyzed for Sr content, from which past histories of habitat use---as measured by salinity---were constructed. Marginal increment analysis of otoliths was conducted to correctly assign microprobe measurements to time of year (season). We classified striped bass into distinct, cohesive migratory ``contingents''. Contingents exhibited four dominant spatial behaviors: (1) long-term residence in the upper Hudson Estuary; (2) long-term residence in the lower Hudson Estuary and western Long Island Sound; (3) coastal habitat use; (4) abrupt mid-life habitat shifts between freshwater and saltwater environments. A freshwater-oligohaline resident behavior was observed for 94\% of individuals collected near Troy Dam, located at the uppermost tidal extent of the Hudson River. As further evidence of their residency, these individuals were also highly contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) due to a local point source. Striped bass may establish residence in the upper estuary because of enhanced foraging opportunities below the Troy Dam. Our study supported Clark's contingent hypothesis, demonstrating that divergent habitat use patterns occur throughout the life-spans of Hudson River striped bass.},

Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock---progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.},

  abstract = {Diel patterns in the schooling behaviour and vertical distribution of pelagic fish schools were studied by examining their echotraces from repeated acoustic survey transects at three inshore sites off the Portuguese coast. At two sites, sardine was the dominant pelagic species, and echotrace characteristics of fish schools were similar to those reported in the literature. At the third site, where there was a multispecies pelagic assemblage that included sardine, there was more variability in several of the school descriptors. At all sites, fish schools expanded after sunset, enlarging their cross-sectional area along the horizontal plane and reducing their mean internal acoustic density, while maintaining their overall mean abundance. Downward migration was rapid (within 1 h) after sunset and simultaneous with school expansion. School-like aggregations with total backscattering similar to daytime schools were present throughout the night, although the proportion of small schools and scattered fish appeared to increase at that time. At dawn, sardine rose back up the water column and rapidly reformed into the typical daytime schools. This pattern of diel vertical migration is opposite to that described for most clupeoids worldwide. The implications of this behaviour on abundance estimation by acoustic monitoring surveys for small pelagic fish are discussed.},

The periods of stock increase and decrease followed consecutive years with positive and negative PDO values, respectively. During the ``warm'' periods, the average number of recruits per biomass was more than threefold higher than that during the ``cold'' periods. In addition to the environmental conditions experienced by the sardine larvae, we show that the variability in sardine recruitment is partially explained by the environmental conditions many months before the spawning season and the adult condition factor. We hypothesize that sardine have a metabolic deficit during spawning, so prior good feeding opportunities are necessary to increase both total fecundity and offspring robustness, to enhance both reproduction and survival, respectively. Our findings augment a century-old theory that the reproductive success of small pelagic fish is governed by the survival of the early life stages. The condition of each parent also matters. To predict sardine recruitment, we propose a ``dual-phase'' model based on seasonal PDObased indices and a condition factor. The model identifies summer feeding seasons conducive to a good adult condition factor followed by spring-spawning seasons supportive of good larval retention and growth.},

  abstract = {High-resolution acoustic and ichtyoplankton sampling with a `continuous under-way fish egg sampler (CUFES)' was performed in two regions of approximately 100 square nautical miles off southern Iberian Peninsula, with the aim of studying the small scale distribution of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) adults and eggs during a spawning event. Very dense patches (246 eggs m- 3) of recently spawned eggs with dimensions (up to 3 nautical miles wide) significantly larger than daytime sardine schools were present in both regions. Egg staging and ageing showed very little intra-sample variation, indicating a synchronous spawning period at dusk. The internal structure of the patches evaluated by variography showed very low internal variability, as if they consisted of a single unit. This hypothesis is confirmed by the acoustic finding of large sardine shoals with similar dimensions to those of the patches after sunset and throughout the night. During that period, adults were found near or in contact with the bottom, suggesting that spawning occurred at depth. A distinct patch of older eggs was found in both areas, but with a few nautical miles of horizontal separation. Their characteristics (a larger area, lower egg densities and a more irregular shape) indicate that these patches were exposed to dispersion and `stirring' by physical forces, reshaping their initial appearance, while mesoscale water circulation could have displaced the core of the patches away by several kilometres within a day.},

  abstract = {Relationships between sardine (Sardina pilchardus) distribution and the environment off western Portugal were explored using data from seven acoustic surveys (spring and autumn of 2000, 2001, 2005, and spring 2006). Four environmental variables (salinity, temperature, chlorophyll a, and acoustic epipelagic backscatter other than fish) were related to the acoustic presence and density of sardine. Univariate quotient analysis revealed sardine preferences for waters with high chlorophyll a content, low temperature and salinity, and low acoustic epipelagic backscatter. Generalized additive models depicted significant relationships between the environment and sardine presence but not with sardine density. Maps of sardine potential habitat (SPH) built upon the presence/absence models revealed a clear seasonal effect in the across-bathymetry and alongshelf extension of SPH off western Portugal. During autumn, SPH covered a large part of the northern Portuguese continental shelf but was almost absent from the southern region, whereas in spring SPH extended farther south but was reduced to a narrow band of shallow coastal waters in the north. This seasonal pattern agrees with the spatio-temporal variation of primary production and oceanic circulation described for the western Iberian shelf.},
